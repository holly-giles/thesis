Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia is a malignancy of mature B lymphocytes, characterised by the accumulation of malignant cells within the blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes. The disease pathogenesis is driven by multiple factors, including molecular features, signalling via the B cell receptor (BCR) and interactions with non-neoplastic cells within the lymphoid tissues (known as the tumour microenvironment). The impact of individual genetic features and microenvironmental signals has been well-characterised, and CLL represents a success story in linking advances in molecular understanding to improvements in clinical approaches. However, very few studies have studied these features integratively, and systematic investigations of the influence of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic features on CLL are lacking.  To investigate the integrative impact of these features on CLL biology, in this thesis I analyse screening data of primary patient samples, combined with multi-omics profiles of the same samples. The screen was performed  using 12 drugs co-applied with 17 individual microenvironmental stimuli on CLL peripheral blood mononucleated cells (n = 192). I combined this data with whole-exome sequencing, DNA-methylation, RNA-sequencing and copy number variant data of matching tumour samples, and additional ATAC-sequencing and RNA-sequencing data for validatory work. The screening data is complemented with *in vivo* data on clinical outcomes, and IHC of patient lymph nodes stained for pSTAT6, pIRAK4 and STAT6.  I apply statistical inference and regression modelling to integrate multiple data types, with the aim of finding new drivers and mechanisms of drug resistance in CLL.  Profiling responses to microenvironmental stimulation across the heterogeneous patient cohort delineates   four patient subgroups that have differential disease progression dynamics, and molecalur profiles, suggesting the dynamics of the microenvironment is important to disease outcomes.  I perform a systematic survey of genetic determinants of microenvironmental response and identify trisomy 12 as a modulator of microenvironemtnal stimulation. THe data suggest that the activity of the transcription factors Spi-B and PU.1 may mediate this effect. I generate a map of interactions between microenvironmental signalling pathways and drugs, and identify novel drug -resistance mechanism including the effect of interferon gamma on ibrutinib toxicity. I demonstrate how drug - microenvironment interactions can be further modulated by molecular features, and identify drug resistance mechanism that occur in suggests of CLL cases. For example, TLR activity induces resistance to fludarabine in IGH-U and triomsy 12 patients, but not in IGHV-M. I demonstrate the *in vivo* relevance of these findings within CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes, which show higher levels of IL4 and TLR signalling compared to non-neoplastic samples (p<0.001). Elevated IL4 signalling in CLL -infiltrated lymphd nodes correlates with poorer outcomes (p=0.038). CLL represents a prototypic model for the study of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic features in cancers. This data set represents an important resource for exploring the impact of these features and I have published the dataset and reproducible analyses as part of an online git repository () and interactive shiny app(). Collectively, these results demonstrate the integrative impact of molecular features and microenvironmental stimuli on drug response and propose potential novel drivers and drug resistance mechanisms and strategies for targeting these in future work.
