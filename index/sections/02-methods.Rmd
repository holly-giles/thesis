### Combinatorial Drug - Stimulus Perturbation Screen
#### Patient Sample Preparation
_HG wrote_
Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 192 patients. A Ficoll gradient (GE Healthcare) was used to separated the samples and mononuclear cells were then cryopreserved. For the screen, samples were thawed and DMSO was removed.  Primary patient samples were next incubated on a roll mixer at room temperature in cell culture medium for a duration of  three hours. This process ensured that any remaining DMSO was removed and to ensure that cell counts would only include those that survived the freezing process.  For the screen,  15 $\mu$l of each PBMC sample was deposited into each well of the plates with stock solution concentration of 1.3\*10\^6 cells/ml. The final cell concentration was 2\*10\^4 cells per well.
 
#### Preparation of screening plates
using the ATP-based CellTiter Glo assay (Promega, Fitchburg, WI, USA) and luminescence level was measured with a Tecan Infinite F200 Microplate Reader(Tecan Group AG, Männedorf, Switzerland).

Compounds were preplated in 384-well polypropylene storage plates (Greiner Bio-One Cat.No.:781271), which were stored at -20$^\circ$C. For each batch of samples tested on the same day a new storage plate was thawed and diluted in serum free RPMI, with or without stimuli. 5$\mu$L of drug-stimulation dilution were then added into each well of the assay plates, 20 $\mu$L of cell suspension were added. The final cell concentration was 8\*10\^5 cells/ml. Cells were thawed as previously described[REFERENCE].

_with Peter-Martin Bruch_ Original 
Stimuli and drugs were mixed and preplated in the culture plates directly before adding the cell suspensions. RPMI-1640 and supplements were acquired from Gibco by Life Technologies, human serum was acquired from PAN Biotech (Cat.No. P40-2701, Lot.No:P-020317). Luminescence was measured after 48h on a Perkin Elmer EnVision." 

_with Peter-Martin Bruch_ Original 
Compounds were obtained from Selleckchem, MedChemExpress and Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved in DMSO and stored at -$20^\circ$C. 12 drugs were used in two concentrations [TABLE]. Final DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.3\% in all experiments. Carfilzomib, Panobinostat and Venetoclax were removed from the analysis as they showed inconsistent toxicity depending on used media.
Insert table

Recombinant cytokines and stimulatory agents were dissolved according to manufacturer's protocol. 17 stimuli were selected [TABLE]. HS-5 conditioned medium was produced by incubating HS-5 stroma cell line (gifted by Martina Seiffert, DKFZ, Heidelberg) for 4 days at 37$^\circ$C and 5% CO2, after which the supernatant was centrifuged and stored at -20$^\circ$C, the final concentration of HS-5 CM was 20\%. Bead immobilised anti-IgM was removed from the analysis due to storage instability. "

#### Drug-Stimulation assay 
_with Peter-Martin Bruch_ Original 
Drug-stimulation assays were performed with RPMI-1640 (Gibco by Life Technologies) supplemented with Penicillin Streptomycin (Gibco) final concentration of 100 Units/ml and 100 $\mu$g/ml respectively, L-Glutamine (Gibco) final concentration 2mM, and 10\% pooled, heat-inactivated and sterile filtered human type AB male off the clot serum (PAN Biotech, Cat.No. P40-2701, Lot.No:P-020317).

Drugs and stimuli were added to the cells simultaneously. Culture was performed in 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One Cat.No.: 781904) and cells were incubated at 37$^\circ$C and 5\% CO2 for 48h.

Cell Viability was determined using the ATP-based CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, Cat.No.:G7573). Luminescence was measured for the drug-stimulation assays using a Perkin Elmer EnVision and for the drug-drug interaction experiments using a Perkin Elmer EnSight, with a measurement time of 100ms per well.

_with Peter-Martin Bruch (mostly edited by me)_ Paper 
"Peripheral blood was taken from 4 CLL patients and separated by Ficoll gradient (GE Healthcare), mononuclear cells were cryopreserved on liquid nitrogen. Samples were later thawed from frozen as previously described[REFERENCE] and MACS sorted for CD19 positive cells (Milteny autoMACS). The cells were resuspended in RPMI (GIBCO, Cat.No. 21875-034), with the addition of 2mM glutamine (GIBCO, Cat.No. 25030-24), 1% Pen/Strep (GIBCO, Cat.No. 15140-122) and 10\% pooled, heat-inactivated and sterile filtered human type AB male off the clot serum (PAN Biotech, Cat.No. P40-2701, Lot.No:P-020317). 5ml of cell suspension was cultured in 6-well plates (Greiner Bio-One Cat.No. 657160). After thawing, cells were incubated at 37$^\circ$C and 5\% CO2 for 6 hours in 0.2\% DMSO. The final cell concentration was 2x10ˆ6 cells/ml. Cell viability and purity was assessed using FACS. All samples had a viability over 90\% and over 95\% of CD19+/CD5+/CD3- cells."

"ATAC-seq libraries were generated as described previously[REFERENCE]. Cell preparation and transposition was performed according to the protocol, starting with 5x10ˆ4 cells per sample. Purified DNA was stored at −20$^\circ$C until library preparation was performed. To generate multiplexed libraries, the transposed DNA was initially amplified for 5x PCR cycles using 2.5 $\mu$L each of 25 μM PCR Primer 1 and 2.5 $\mu$L of 25 $\mu$M Barcoded PCR Primer 2 (included in the Nextera index kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), 25 $\mu$L of NEBNext High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Boston, Massachusetts) in a total volume of 50 $\mu$L. 5 $\mu$L of the amplified DNA was used to determine the appropriate number of additional PCR cycles using qPCR. Additional number of cycles was calculated through the plotting of the linear Rn versus cycle, and corresponds to one-third of the maximum fluorescent intensity. Finally, amplification was performed on the remaining 45 $\mu$L of the PCR reaction using the optimal number of cycles determined for each library by qPCR (max. 13 cycles in total). The amplified fragments were purified with two rounds of SPRI bead clean-up (1.4x). The size distribution of the libraries was assessed on Bioanalyzer with a DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), concentration was measured with Qubit DNA High Sensitivity kit in Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using 75bp paired-end sequencing, generating ∼450 million paired-reads per run, with an average of 55 million reads per sample."

## Statistical Analysis 
Mixutre of paper and original 
Integrative data analysis of screening data, DNA and RNA sequencing, CNV and methylation profiles and follow up experiments was performed using R version 4 (REFERENCE R Core Team, 2018) with the RStudio interface (REFERENCE RStudio Team, 2016) and using packages that included [@R-DESeq2], [@R-survival], [@R-glmnet], [@R-ConsensusClusterPlus], [@R-clusterProfiler], [@R-ChIPseeker], [@R-genomation] and [@R-BloodCancerMultiOmics2017] to perform univariate association tests, multivariate regression with and without lasso penalization, Cox regression, generalised linear modelling and clustering. 

### Data processing
#### Processing of screening data
_with Peter-Martin Bruch_ Paper 
To quantify the response of a patient sample to each treatment condition, we used viability relative to the control, i.e., the CellTiter Glo luminescence readout of the respective well divided by the median of luminescence readouts of the DMSO control wells on the same plate.

### Analysis of Screening Data
#### Drug-drug and stimulus - stimulus correlations {#correlations}
_myself_ original complete 
Section \@ref(cytokine-profiling). Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each drug - drug and stimulus - stimulus pair, using the `cor` functions of the [@R-base] package with log transformed viability values which were normalised to untreated controls.

#### Characterising stimulus responses across all samples {#stimulus-heatmap-method}
_myself_ original complete (just check)
Section \@ref(clusters). For the heatmap in figure \@ref(fig:stimuliHeatmap), the viability data is represented as z scores. Log transformed viability values, normalised to DMSO controls, are row-scaled  according to the Median Absolute Deviance.  Limits were then applied to this row scaling factor for optimal visualisation. The matrix of z scores was plotted using the [@R-pheatmap] package. The ordering of the columns (patient samples) was obtained from the dendrogram that resulted from running `ConsensusClusterPlus`, from the [@R-ConsensusClusterPlus] package. The rows were ordered using the dendrogram order produced by `hclust` with default branch arrangement.

#### Univariate analysis of gene - stimulus and gene - drug response assosciations {#univariate-gene-stimulus-associations-method}
_myself_ writtten for thesis complete
Section \@ref(univariate-gene-stimulus-associations) & \@ref(univariate-gene-drug-associations). Two-sided Student's t-tests, with equal variance were performed for IGHV status and somatic mutations and copy number aberrations with ≥3 patient samples in each group (n = 63/54). A 10% FDR cut off was used to determine significance. 

#### Penalised multivariate regression of gene - stimulus and gene - drug assosciations {#multivariate-gene-stimulus-assosciations-method}
_myself_ written for thesis (but some overlap with JCI) 
Section \@ref(multivariate-gene-stimulus-assosciations) & \@ref(multivariate-gene-drug-assosciations).  
ADAPT FOR DRUGS ALSO A Gaussian linear model with L1-penalty implemented in the `R` package `glmnet` [@R-glmnet], with mixing parameter alpha = 1,was used to identify gene-stimulus associations. Matrix of genetic features (p=39), IGHV status (encoded as M = 1 and U = 0), and Methylation Cluster (encoded as 0, 0.5, 1) were used to identify multivariate predictors. All features were thus encoded on a similar scale to ensure equal treatment by lasso constraint in model fitting.  Genetic features with more than 20% missing values were excluded from the analysis, and samples without complete annotation for remaining features were removed, resulting in n = 129 samples. The matrix of control-normalised log-transformed viability values for these 129 samples was provided as the dependent variable. Using 3-fold cross-validation, the optimal penalty parameter $\lambda$  was selected so as to minimise the cross-validated R2. The reduction in cross-validated mean squared error compared to the null model was used as loss. The model was fitted for 30 bootstrapped repeats, and the resulting coefficients are the mean of those coefficients that were selected in >75% model fits. 

 
#### Correlation of RNA-Receptor Expression with viability
_myself_ original complete 
RNA count data for matched samples was available for 49 patients and was transformed using the variance stabilising transformation. Stimulus - receptor pairs were defined using the available literature, see table \@ref(tab:receptorPairs).  For each stimulus, pearson correlation coefficient were calculated between the control-normalised log-transformed viability value of a sample and its expression of the corresponding stimulus receptor. 

#### Linear modelling of drug - stimulus interactions {#drug-stimulus-linear-model-method}
_myself_ original 
Section \@ref(drug-stimulus-linear-model) Linear models were fitted for each drug - stimulus combination, to extract a $\beta{int}$ term and assossciated p value for each combinatorial treatment. Linear model was fitted using equation \@ref(eq:drugCytInt), using the `lm` function of the `R` package stats [@R-base]:
    \begin{equation}
            log(V) = \beta_{drug}X_{drug} + \beta_{stimulus}X_{stimulus} + \beta_{int}X_{drug}X_{stimulus} + \epsilon
                                       (\#eq:drugCytInt)
    \end{equation}
    
_where $V$ is the predicted viability with a given treatment,_ $\beta_{drug}$, $\beta_{stimulus}$ _and_ $\beta_{int}$ _are coefficients for the drug, stimulus and combinatorial terms and_ $X_{drug}$ _and_ $X_{stimulus}$  _are indicator variables (0 or 1) for the presence or absence of a drug/stimulus._ $\epsilon$ _is the vector of model residuals. Equation from Bruch & Giles et al. 2021._

To fit model, the matrix of log-transformed viability values, for control, single and combinatorial treatments was used. Interactions were defined as significant if p value for $\beta{int}$ < 0.05. The matrix of significant $\beta{int}$ was then plotted as a heatmap, with the package `pheatmap`[@R-pheatmap] where the rows (stimuli) and columns (drugs) were ordered according to the dendrogram order produced by `hclust` [@R-base] using default branch arrangement.

To define the four interaction categories, drug - stimulus combinations were first divided with respect to the sign of $\beta{int}$, whereby a positive $\beta{int}$ indicates that the viability with combinatorial treatment is higher than would be expected based on additive effects alone and vice versa. The groups were further divided into synergies and antagonisms according to the values of the model coefficients ($\beta{drug}$, $\beta{stimulus}$ and $\beta{int}$). Synergisms were assigned when coefficients for single treatments ($\beta{drug}$ and $\beta{stimulus}$) were both greater than, or both less than, the observed coefficient for the combinatorial treatment (i.e. $\beta{drug}$ + $\beta{stimulus}$ + $\beta{int}$). For positive antagonisms, $\beta{drug}$ + $\beta{stimulus}$ + $\beta{int}$ was less than either $\beta{drug}$ or $\beta{stimulus}$. For negative antagonisms,  $\beta{drug}$ + $\beta{stimulus}$ + $\beta{int}$ was greater than either $\beta{drug}$ or $\beta{stimulus}$. All drug - stimulus interactions, for which p value for $\beta{int}$ <0.05 fit into one of these groups. 

#### Modelling of drug - stimulus - gene interactions {#drug-stimulus-gene-interactions-method}
_myself_ original 
Section \@ref(drug-stimulus-gene-interactions). To identify drug - stimulus interactions that were dependent on genetic features, we first fitted linear models to the viability matrix, for each drug - stimulus combination, using the formula in Eqn2. We extracted drug - stimulus interaction coefficients for each patient to generate a response matrix for n = 137 patients. Next, we performed multivariate regression using a Gaussian linear model with L1-penalty (i.e., lasso regression) as implemented in the R package `glmnet`[@R-glmnet]. As the dependent variable, the matrix of drug - stimulus interaction coefficients for each patient sample was used. As input to the model, genetic features with more than 20\% missing values were excluded, and only patients with complete annotation were included in the model ( n= 137 ). As predictors, the genetic mutations and CNVs (p= 39), IGHV status (coded as 0-1) and Methylation CLuster (coded as 0, 0.5, 1) were used,  using 3-fold cross-validation. Misclassification error was used as loss for cross- validation.

Equation \@ref(eq:drugCytGeneInt) quantifies how the viability with any combination can be predicted:
    \begin{equation}
            log(V) = \beta_{drug}X_{drug} + \beta_{stimulus}X_{stimulus} + \beta_{patient}X_{patient} + \beta_{drug-stimulus}X_{drug}X_{stimulus} + \beta_{drug-patient}X_{drug}X_{patient} + \beta_{stimulus-patient}X_{stimulus}X_{patient} +\beta_{int}X_{drug}X_{stimulus}X_{patient} + \epsilon
                                       (\#eq:drugCytGeneInt)
    \end{equation}
    
_where $V$ is the predicted viability of a patient sample with a given treatment,_ $\beta_{drug}$, $\beta_{stimulus}$,$\beta_{int}$, $\beta_{drug-stimulus}$,$\beta_{drug-patient}$,$\beta_{drug-stimulus}$ _and_ $\beta_{int}X_{drug}$ _are regression coefficients for the drug, stimulus, patient sample and combinatorial terms and_ $X_{drug}$, $X_{stimulus}$ _and_ $X_{patient}$ _are indicator variables (0 or 1) for the presence or absence of a drug/stimulus/patient sample._ $\epsilon$ _is the vector of model residuals. See also Methods section \@ref(drug-stimulus-gene-interactions-method). Equation from Bruch & Giles et al. 2021._

This generates a higher order interaction term $\beta_{int}X_{drug}X_{stimulus}X_{patient}$. This term represents a _patient sample-specific_ $\beta{int}$ for each drug - stimulus combination, quantifying the size of an interaction between a drug and stimulus in each patient genetic background. 

With these patient sample-specific $\beta{int}$ terms, it was possible to search for associations between the size of $\beta_{int}$) and genetic features. The aim was to screen for molecular features that increased or decreased the size of a drug - stimulus interactions, using multivariate regression with L1 (lasso) regularisation.

As input to the model, the response matrix was composed of the sample - specific $\beta_{int}$ values for each drug-stimulus combination. To generate the feature matrix (137 samples versus 40 features), I excluded genetic features for which >20\% of the values were missing, and  patient samples with incomplete annotation. As predictors, I included genetic mutations and CNVs (p=39) and IGHV status (coded as 0-1). I ran lasso regression, as implemented in the `R` package `glmnet`[@R-glmnet], using three-fold cross-validation with misclassification error as loss. The resulting predictors are the mean of those coefficients that were selected in at least 90% of 30 bootstrapped repeats.

_Herbst et al., 2020c_ - update
Section \@ref(cluster-survival). "Patients which had lymphocyte counts available for less than 4 time points between the sample
collection date and the time of the next treatment and patients currently in treatment were ex-cluded. Thus, ... patients with enough data remained.  Lymphocyte growth rates were calculated by fitting a linear model to the log10 transformed lymphocyte counts of all timepoints between the sample collection date and the time of the next treatment versus the period of time."

#### Survival analyses {#survival-method}
_myself_ original 
Section \@ref(cluster-survival).  Survival analyses were performed using TTT, TFT and OS as metrics.  Follow-up information to calculate OS was available for all 192 CLL patients. For 188 of 192 CLL patients treatment information after sample collection was available. 

_Herbst et al_
”Time to next treatment (TTT) was calculated from the date of sample collection to subsequent
treatment initiation. Patients without treatment initiation during the observation time and
patients who died before treatment initiation were censored at the latest follow-up contact."

_myself_ original 
For for the purpose of visualising Kaplan-Meier plots , optimal cut-points of staining levels were calculated using maximally selected rank statistics as computed by the `R` package `maxstat` [@R-maxstat]. Based on these cut points, patients were split into two groups, and their survival data were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier method, using the R package `survminer` [@R-survminer]. 

For Cox proportional hazards regression, the  `coxph` function of the `R` package `survival` [@R-survival] was used. Expand 

#### Penalised multivariate regression genetic predictors of cluster membership {#cluster-genetics-method}
_Myself_ original (edit so not similar to JCI)
Section \@ref(genetics-method). I used a multinomial linear model with L1-penalty, implemented in the `glmnet` [@R-glmnet] package. As the dependent variable, the cluster assignment for each patient was used. As input to the model ,genetic features with more than 20\% missing values were excluded, and only patients with complete annotation were included in the model ( n= 137 ). As predictors, the genetic mutations and CNVs (p= 39) and IGHV status (coded as 0-1) were used,  using 3-fold cross-validation. Misclassification error was used as loss for cross- validation. The resulting coefficients indicated associations between genetic features and each cluster. 
 
#### Gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis between clusters {#cluster-rna-method}
_myself_ original
Section \@ref(cluster-rna). For the n=49 patient samples for which viability data and RNA–Seq data for matching samples was available, the `R` package `DESeq2` [@R-DESeq2] was used to search for associations of these two data types.RNA-Seq read count data was regressed on to the patient clusters C3, C4 (design formula ~ IGHV.status + Cluster). Genes were ranked by their test statistics and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (implementing the fgsea algorithm with the `clusterProfiler` [@R-clusterProfiler] package) was applied to the ranked lists with the KEGG pathway gene set selections from the MSigDBdatabase[REFERENCE].  

#### Associations of ex-vivo stimulus responses with genomic features
We tested for associations between stimulus viability assay results and genomic features by Student’s t-tests (two-sided, with equal variance). We tested somatic mutations (aggregated at the gene level), copy number aberrations and IGHV status. We restricted the analysis to features that were present in at least 3 patient samples (63 features). p-values were adjusted for multiple testing by applying the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. 

#### Analysis of differential gene dosage in trisomy 12 CLL {#gene-dosage-effects-method}
_myself_ written for thesis 
Section \@ref(gene-dosage-effects). For all RNA samples available in PACE (i.e. not just those that matched the samples in the screen), differential expression was called using the `DESeq2` package [@R-DESeq2], with the design formula ~trisomy12.  Raw RNA counts were visualised if the gene had BH-adjusted p < 0.1 and belonged to TGF$\beta$, JAK-STAT or TLR pathways genesets, as defined in the KEGG database [@Kegg] downloaded using the `msigdbr` package [@R-msigdbr]. Proteomic abundance data was also plotted, provided by Sophie Herbst [@HerbstThesis]. Proteomics data partially overlaps with RNAseq data. Protein quantification was performed as described in @HerbstThesis. 

#### Generation of a Trisomy 12 classifier {#trisomy12-classifier-method}
_edit and finish_ 
Section \@ref(trisomy12-classifier). To build the classifier,  a binomial linear model with L1-penalty implemented in the `R` package `glmnet` [@R-glmnet], with mixing parameter alpha = 1, was used. To identify coefficients that predict trisomy 12 status, the viability matrix for all stimuli,  as described in section \@ref(stimulus-heatmap-method) was used, i.e. z scores of the control-normalised log-transformed viability values. 

Matrix of genetic features (p=39), IGHV status (encoded as M = 1 and U = 0), and Methylation Cluster (encoded as 0, 0.5, 1) were used to identify multivariate predictors. All features were thus encoded on a similar scale to ensure equal treatment by lasso constraint in model fitting.  Genetic features with more than 20% missing values were excluded from the analysis, and samples without complete annotation for remaining features were removed, resulting in n = 129 samples. The matrix of control-normalised log-transformed viability values for these 129 samples was provided as the dependent variable. Using 3-fold cross-validation, the optimal penalty parameter $\lambda$  was selected so as to minimise the cross-validated R2. The reduction in cross-validated mean squared error compared to the null model was used as loss. The model was fitted for 30 bootstrapped repeats, and the resulting coefficients are the mean of those coefficients that were selected in >75% model fits. 

The classifier was built using binomial regression, with lasso penalisation,  as implemented in the `R` package `glmnet` [@R-glmnet]. The feature matrix consisted of z scores of the viability values after treatment with each stimulus, and was used to predict the response (trisomy 12 status). I ran the model for 50 bootstrapped repeats, using  three-fold cross-validation and mean absolute error as loss. Resiquimod, sCD40L+IL4 and TGF$\beta$ were selected as coefficients that predict trisomy 12 status (Figure \@ref(fig:tri12Classfier), as would be expected bed on the observations in section \@ref(trisomy12-modulator).

Original dataset had 88 ATAC-seq samples from 55 patients, however we used for the analysis only one sample per patient passing quality checks, resulting in 52 samples. We used an in-house constructed ATAC-seq processing pipeline [@Berest2019] to obtain final bam files mapped to the hg19 annotation genome that were corrected for CG bias. 

#### Annotation of trisomy 12 status
_with Ivan Berest_ original (update to paper) 
As trisomy 12 status was not included in the original metadata, we used a mean amount of reads in the chromatin accessible peaks for each sample to distinguish trisomy 12 patients. All samples containing 1.4 times more reads in the peaks located on chromosome 12, compared to the peaks on all other chromosomes, were classified as trisomy 12 patients.

#### diffTF analysis of TF activity in trisomy 12 CLL
_with Ivan Berest_ original (update to paper) 
FOr the larger ATACseq dataset, we ran analytical mode of diffTF [@R-diffTF] pipeline to investigate differential TF activity between trisomy 12 and non-trisomy 12 patients using the HOCOMOCO v10 database [@HOCOMOCO] with the following design formula: “~ Batch + Gender + IGHV status + trisomy12 status”. 

for tirsomy 12 software uses the ATACseq counts at each of the binding sites across the genome to generate a distribution of fold changes between trisomy 12 and WT samples. This fold change distribution is compared to a background distribution of fold changes, calculated similarly using ATACseq counts for a GC-matched motif, that does not contain the TF binding motif. The TF is classified as differentially active between trisomy 12 and WT samples where these two distributions are significantly different. Each TF is assigned a weighted mean difference value, which quantifies the change in activity, and a p value. 

For the smaller ATACseq dataset, ATAC-seq data generated from our CLL samples were processed similarly with the in-house ATAC-seq pipeline, as described previously [@Berest2019], with the only exception that we didn’t use CG bias correction step. We used a similarly analytical mode of diffTF with HOCOMOCO v10 database [@HOCOMOCO] using the following parameters: minOverlap = 1; design formula = “~ Patient + Trisomy 12 status”.  

#### Functional enrichment analysis of SPIB ChIPseq data
_myeslf_ original (update to paper) 
We downloaded SPIB ChIPseq data [REFERENCE] from the NCBI GEO database[REFERENCE], accession GEO:GSE56857. We made use of the data for SPIB in the OCILY3 DLBCL cell line (GSM1370276). SPIB ChIP peaks were filtered for significance (q value<0.05). We used the annotatePeaks function from the package clusterProfiler[REFERENCE] to annotate the nearest gene for each ChIPpeak. We filtered peaks  within ±1kb of a TSS of a gene and performed over-representation of  KEGG and Reactome pathways (using the clusterProfiler package[REFERENCE])  amongst the resulting list of genes.
