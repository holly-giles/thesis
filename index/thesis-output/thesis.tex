    The tumour microenvironment and genetic alterations collectively influence disease biology and drug resistance in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL). To establish an integrative understanding of these factors in CLL biology, we performed a combinatorial assay using 12 drugs individually co-applied with each of 17 microenvironmental stimuli on 192 samples of CLL peripheral blood mononucleated cells. We examined microenvironment response across a heterogeneous patient cohort and identified four distinct CLL subgroups that differed in their response landscapes and in patient outcomes. By combining our data with whole-exome sequencing, DNA-methylation, RNA-sequencing and copy number variant data of the same tumours, we systematically searched for molecular determinants of stimulus response and found trisomy 12 as a key modulator. Our data suggest that the amplifying effect of trisomy 12 on the response to environmental signals is mediated by the transcription factors Spi-B and PU.1. We generated a comprehensive map of drug-microenvironment interactions in CLL, and profiled the modulating impact of genetic features on these antagonistic and synergistic effects. Interleukin (IL) 4 and Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 7/8/9 stimuli showed the most interactions. Both pathways were more active in CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes than in healthy samples (p\textless0.001), and high IL4 activity in lymph nodes correlated with shorter survival (p=0.038). We provide a multi-layered resource to investigate microenvironmental and drug interplay in CLL (\href{https://git.embl.de/giles/cllcytokinescreen2021}{Repository} \& \href{https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.imbi.uni-heidelberg.de/dietrichlab/CLL_Microenvironment/\&sa=D\&source=editors\&ust=1625764640786000\&usg=AOvVaw01HOFP7k2BJRLTteCXa8qy}{Shiny}). Our results highlight the importance of cell-extrinsic influences on drug response and disease progression, and how these further depend on molecular features.

\emph{with Peter-Martin Bruch} Original
``Sample preparation, cell-culture, drug-stimulation profiling and genomic annotation was performed on 192 CLL patient samples as previously described{[}REFERENCE{]} with the following adjustments. Stimuli and drugs were mixed and preplated in the culture plates directly before adding the cell suspensions. RPMI-1640 and supplements were acquired from Gibco by Life Technologies, human serum was acquired from PAN Biotech (Cat.No. P40-2701, Lot.No:P-020317). Luminescence was measured after 48h on a Perkin Elmer EnVision.''

\emph{with Peter-Martin Bruch} Original
Compounds were obtained from Selleckchem, MedChemExpress and Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved in DMSO and stored at -\(20^\circ\)C. 12 drugs were used in two concentrations {[}TABLE{]}. Final DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.3\% in all experiments. Carfilzomib, Panobinostat and Venetoclax were removed from the analysis as they showed inconsistent toxicity depending on used media.
Insert table

Recombinant cytokines and stimulatory agents were dissolved according to manufacturer's protocol. 17 stimuli were selected {[}TABLE{]}. HS-5 conditioned medium was produced by incubating HS-5 stroma cell line (gifted by Martina Seiffert, DKFZ, Heidelberg) for 4 days at 37\(^\circ\)C and 5\% CO2, after which the supernatant was centrifuged and stored at -20\(^\circ\)C, the final concentration of HS-5 CM was 20\%. Bead immobilised anti-IgM was removed from the analysis due to storage instability. ''

Paper:
``Compounds and stimulatory agents were dissolved, stored and diluted according to manufacturer's protocol. HS-5 conditioned medium was produced by incubating HS-5 stromal cell line to \textgreater80\% confluency and cell removal by centrifugation. For a detailed list of stimuli and drugs and associated concentrations see Supp. Tables 1 and 2. Final DMSO concentration did not exceed 0.3\%.''

Original
Compounds were preplated in 384-well polypropylene storage plates (Greiner Bio-One Cat.No.:781271), which were stored at -20\(^\circ\)C. For each batch of samples tested on the same day a new storage plate was thawed and diluted in serum free RPMI, with or without stimuli. 5\(\mu\)L of drug-stimulation dilution were added into each well of the assay plates, 20 \(\mu\)L of cell suspension were added. The final cell concentration was 8*10\^{}5 cells/ml. Cells were thawed as previously described{[}REFERENCE{]}.

\hypertarget{drug-stimulation-assay}{%
\section{Drug-Stimulation assay}\label{drug-stimulation-assay}}

\emph{with Peter-Martin Bruch} Original
Drug-stimulation assays were performed with RPMI-1640 (Gibco by Life Technologies) supplemented with Penicillin Streptomycin (Gibco) final concentration of 100 Units/ml and 100 \(\mu\)g/ml respectively, L-Glutamine (Gibco) final concentration 2mM, and 10\% pooled, heat-inactivated and sterile filtered human type AB male off the clot serum (PAN Biotech, Cat.No. P40-2701, Lot.No:P-020317).

Drugs and stimuli were added to the cells simultaneously. Culture was performed in 384-well plates (Greiner Bio-One Cat.No.: 781904) and cells were incubated at 37\(^\circ\)C and 5\% CO2 for 48h.

Cell Viability was determined using the ATP-based CellTiter-Glo assay (Promega, Cat.No.:G7573). Luminescence was measured for the drug-stimulation assays using a Perkin Elmer EnVision and for the drug-drug interaction experiments using a Perkin Elmer EnSight, with a measurement time of 100ms per well.

``Peripheral blood was taken from 4 CLL patients and separated by Ficoll gradient (GE Healthcare), mononuclear cells were cryopreserved on liquid nitrogen. Samples were later thawed from frozen as previously described{[}REFERENCE{]} and MACS sorted for CD19 positive cells (Milteny autoMACS). The cells were resuspended in RPMI (GIBCO, Cat.No. 21875-034), with the addition of 2mM glutamine (GIBCO, Cat.No. 25030-24), 1\% Pen/Strep (GIBCO, Cat.No. 15140-122) and 10\% pooled, heat-inactivated and sterile filtered human type AB male off the clot serum (PAN Biotech, Cat.No. P40-2701, Lot.No:P-020317). 5ml of cell suspension was cultured in 6-well plates (Greiner Bio-One Cat.No. 657160). After thawing, cells were incubated at 37\(^\circ\)C and 5\% CO2 for 6 hours in 0.2\% DMSO. The final cell concentration was 2x10Ë6 cells/ml. Cell viability and purity was assessed using FACS. All samples had a viability over 90\% and over 95\% of CD19+/CD5+/CD3- cells.''

\emph{with Nayara} Paper
``ATAC-seq libraries were generated as described previously{[}REFERENCE{]}. Cell preparation and transposition was performed according to the protocol, starting with 5x10Ë4 cells per sample. Purified DNA was stored at â20\(^\circ\)C until library preparation was performed. To generate multiplexed libraries, the transposed DNA was initially amplified for 5x PCR cycles using 2.5 \(\mu\)L each of 25 Î¼M PCR Primer 1 and 2.5 \(\mu\)L of 25 \(\mu\)M Barcoded PCR Primer 2 (included in the Nextera index kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), 25 \(\mu\)L of NEBNext High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Boston, Massachusetts) in a total volume of 50 \(\mu\)L. 5 \(\mu\)L of the amplified DNA was used to determine the appropriate number of additional PCR cycles using qPCR. Additional number of cycles was calculated through the plotting of the linear Rn versus cycle, and corresponds to one-third of the maximum fluorescent intensity. Finally, amplification was performed on the remaining 45 \(\mu\)L of the PCR reaction using the optimal number of cycles determined for each library by qPCR (max. 13 cycles in total). The amplified fragments were purified with two rounds of SPRI bead clean-up (1.4x). The size distribution of the libraries was assessed on Bioanalyzer with a DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), concentration was measured with Qubit DNA High Sensitivity kit in Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using 75bp paired-end sequencing, generating â¼450 million paired-reads per run, with an average of 55 million reads per sample.''

Peripheral blood was taken from 4 CLL patients and separated by Ficoll gradient (GE Healthcare), mononuclear cells were cryopreserved on liquid nitrogen. Samples were later thawed from frozen as previously described{[}REFERENCE{]} and MACS sorted for CD19 positive cells (Milteny autoMACS). The cells were resuspended in RPMI (GIBCO, Cat.No. 21875-034), with the addition of 2mM glutamine (GIBCO, Cat.No. 25030-24), 1\% Pen/Strep (GIBCO, Cat.No. 15140-122) and 10\% pooled, heat-inactivated and sterile filtered human type AB male off the clot serum (PAN Biotech, Cat.No. P40-2701, Lot.No:P-020317). 5ml of cell suspension was cultured in 6-well plates (Greiner Bio-One Cat.No. 657160). After thawing, cells were incubated at 37\(^\circ\)C and 5\% CO2 for 6 hours in 0.2\% DMSO. The final cell concentration was 2x10Ë6 cells/ml. Cell viability and purity was assessed using FACS. All samples had a viability over 90\% and over 95\% of CD19+/CD5+/CD3- cells.

ATAC-seq libraries were generated as described previously{[}REFERENCE{]}. Cell preparation and transposition was performed according to the protocol, starting with 5x10Ë4 cells per sample. Purified DNA was stored at â20\(^\circ\)C until library preparation was performed. To generate multiplexed libraries, the transposed DNA was initially amplified for 5x PCR cycles using 2.5 \(\mu\)L each of 25 \(\mu\)M PCR Primer 1 and 2.5 \(\mu\)L of 25 \(\mu\)M Barcoded PCR Primer 2 (included in the Nextera index kit, Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), 25 \(\mu\)L of NEBNext High-Fidelity 2x PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Boston, Massachusetts) in a total volume of 50\(\mu\)L. 5 \(\mu\) L of the amplified DNA was used to determine the appropriate number of additional PCR cycles using qPCR. Additional number of cycles was calculated through the plotting of the linear Rn versus cycle, and corresponds to one-third of the maximum fluorescent intensity. Finally, amplification was performed on the remaining 45 \(\mu\)L of the PCR reaction using the optimal number of cycles determined for each library by qPCR (max. 13 cycles in total). The amplified fragments were purified with two rounds of SPRI bead clean-up (1.4x). The size distribution of the libraries was assessed on Bioanalyzer with a DNA High Sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA), concentration was measured with Qubit DNA High Sensitivity kit in Qubit 2.0 Flurometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using 75bp paired-end sequencing, generating â¼450 million paired-reads per run, with an average of 55 million reads per sample.

To identify drug - stimulus interactions that were dependent on genetic features, we first fitted linear models to the viability matrix, for each drug - stimulus combination, using the formula in Eqn2. We extracted drug - stimulus interaction coefficients for each patient to generate a response matrix for n = 137 patients. Next, we performed multivariate regression using a Gaussian linear model with L1-penalty (i.e., lasso regression) as implemented in the R package glmnet{[}REFERENCE{]}. As the dependent variable, the matrix of drug - stimulus interaction coefficients for each patient sample was used. As input to the model, genetic features with more than 20\% missing values were excluded, and only patients with complete annotation were included in the model ( n= 137 ). As predictors, the genetic mutations and CNVs (p= 39), IGHV status (coded as 0-1) and Methylation CLuster (coded as 0, 0.5, 1) were used, using 3-fold cross-validation. Misclassification error was used as loss for cross- validation.

\chapter{Ex-vivo sensitivity to microenvironmental stimulation in primary CLL cells}\label{ex-vivo-sensitivity-to-microenvironmental-stimulation-in-primary-cll-cells}}

The screen included 17 cytokines and microenvironmental stimuli, which were selected based on evidence in the literature that each stimulus had been shown to impact on CLL viability \emph{in vitro}. We attempted to put together the largest panel of stimuli for an assay of this kind in CLL, aiming to minimise redundancy among the compounds (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021).

CLL cells do not proliferate \emph{in vitro}, but rather undergo spontaneous apoptosis in the absence of stimulation (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Collins1989}{Collins et al. 1989}). The effect of each stimuli on CLL viability was thus quantified by comparing ATP counts in treated primary samples, compared with those in DMSO wells where a positive value indicates that the sample viability was increased relative to control.

The assay represents a reductionist model of microenvironmental signalling, making it possible to dissect the effect of individual stimuli on baseline viability. The large patient cohort also enabled us to study the differential impact of these stimuli across heterogeneous samples, and identify distinct subgroups of patients whose samples show similar response profiles to the panel of stimuli.

To investigate heterogeneity amongst responses to the stimuli, I calculated Pearson correlation coefficients for each stimulus pair, using the log-transformed normalised viabilities (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021). The resulting coefficients were ordered using hierarchical clustering and visualised in a symmetrical heatmap (Figure \ref{fig:stimuliCorrelations}). The hierarchical clustering distinguished clusters of stimuli, including a larger group corresponding to agonists of TLR and Nf\(\kappa\)B pathways and a smaller group encompassing IL4 and TLR stimuli.


\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/stimuliCorrelations-1}

\caption{Heatmap of Pearson correlation coefficients. Coefficients for each pair of stimuli were calculated using log transformed viability values normalised to untreated control, and ordered according to hierarchical clustering. Figure adapted from Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021.}\label{fig:stimuliCorrelations}
\end{figure}
98.5\% of stimulus pairs showed little correlation (R \textless{} 0.6), including those that targeted similar downstream pathways, indicating a high degree of functional diversity amongst microenvironmental signals. For example, JAK-STAT agonists such as IL4 and IL6 showed little correlation (Figure \ref{fig:correlationsScatter}A).

Only two stimulus pairs showed correlations where R \textgreater{} 0.6, and in both cases these targeted near identical receptors or downstream pathways. These included CpG ODN (TLR 9) and Resiquimod (TLR 7 and 8) (Figure \ref{fig:correlationsScatter}B), and IL4 and IL4 + CD40L which primarily target JAK3 - STAT6.

Repeating the analysis to correlate drug - drug pairs demonstrated that drugs targeting components of the same pathway were highly correlated. For quality control purposes, this indicated that our data sensitively and specifically reflect inter-individual differences in pathway dependencies (\protect\hyperlink{ref-JCIpaper}{Dietrich et al. 2017}).


\begin{figure}

\caption{Scatter plot of log-transformed viability values, normalised to DMSO controls, for (A) treatment with JAK-STAT agonists IL4 and IL6 and (B) treatment with TLR agonists CpG ODN and Resiquimod.}\label{fig:correlationsScatter}
\end{figure}
Microenvironmental stimulation induced diverse phenotypes between patient samples, and across different stimuli. To gain a global overview of these phenotypes, I visualised log-transformed viability values normalised to DMSO controls for all patient samples and all stimuli (Figure \ref{fig:stimuliBeeswarms} (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021).


\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/stimuliBeeswarms-1}

\caption{Log transformed viabilities after treatment with each stimulus. Where stimuli decreased viability relative to control, points are shown in blue, whilst increased viability is shown in red. Figure adapted from Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021.}\label{fig:stimuliBeeswarms}
\end{figure}
The majority of the stimuli increased viability, underlining the supportive nature of the microenvironment in CLL. However, three out of 17 reduced CLL viability relative to control, namely IL6, TGF\(\beta\) and TLR 7/8/9 agonists in IGHV-mutated (IGHV-M) samples.

IL4 and TLR7/8/9 agonists Resiquimod and CpG ODN induced the strongest responses, an indication of their potency in modulating CLL cell survival. Notably, TLR agonists increased viability in certain samples, in most cases IGHV-U, and decreased viability in others, mostly IGHV-M. Both IL4 and TLR7/8/9 emerged as the key pathways in the screen, and play an important role throughout the results of this thesis.

\subsection{Microenvironmental response profiling identifies discrete patient subgroups}\label{microenvironmental-response-profiling-identifies-discrete-patient-subgroups}}

To further investigate the variability in responses across the cohort, we visualised z scores of the log-transformed viabilities and performed consensus clustering on the resulting matrix to generate a heatmap of all stimuli responses across all samples (Figure \ref{fig:stimuliHeatmap}.


\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/stimuliHeatmap-1}

\caption{The heatmap matrix shows the viability measurements for 192 samples (columns) and 17 stimuli (rows). Viability was measured via ATP-based assay after 48h stimulation. The data are shown normalised to DMSO-treated controls, and scaled within each row according to the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD). Limits were applied to scaling factor for optimal visualisation. The colour bars to the right show sample annotations. Consensus Clustering was used to define column tree layout, using hierarchical clustering with the Euclidean metric. Figure from Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021.}\label{fig:stimuliHeatmap}

The heatmap reflects heterogeneity in responses across samples and stimuli, once again underlining the potency of IL4 in increasing sample viability across diverse genetic backgrounds and the diversity in responses to TLR stimulation by Resiquimod and CpG ODN.

To generate the column-wise clustering, consensus clustering was performed on the matrix of z scores. Consensus clustering allows the user to subsample from the matrix of values, to generate hierarchical clustering for a given number of clusters, k. From this, it is possible to calculate a consensus matrix for each value of k, indicating for each pair of values the proportion of time they occupy the same cluster when subsampled together.

I visualised the clustered heatmap in Figure \ref{fig:stimuliHeatmap} for different values of k, and concluded on the existence of four robust clusters within the cohort (add these to appendix?). Each cluster shows a unique response profile to the panel of stimuli. We termed the clusters C1 to C4: C1 and C2 were enriched for IGHV-U whilst the samples in C3 and C4 were mostly IGHV-M.

To validate the choice of four clusters, I visualised the summaries of the consensus matrix, using the \texttt{ConsensusClusterPlus} package (\protect\hyperlink{ref-ConsensusClusterPlus}{Wilkerson and Hayes 2010}), to quantify the degree of confidence in the clusters for different values of k.

\end{figure}
The graph of the CDFs of the consensus matrix for each k indicated that the CDF reaches a maximum and cluster confidence is maximised at k = 7 , though above k = 4 there is little appreciable increase. Figure \ref{fig:consensusClusteringA}. This is confirmed in the graph showing relative change in the area under the CDF curve, showing there is only a small increase in consensus between k = 4 and k =5, supporting the choice of k = 4. The cluster tracking plot depicts how each patient sample is assigned for each value of k. For k = 4, the plot indicates that C3 and 4 in particular are highly stable (Figure \ref{fig:consensusClusteringB}).

The heatmap in Figure \ref{fig:stimuliHeatmap} demonstrated that each cluster responded differently to the panel of stimuli.

Amongst the IGHV-U enriched C1 and C2, both showed strong, positive responses to IL4 and TLR7/8/9 stimulation. C2 could be distinguished by stronger responses to the stimuli overall, in particular to NF\(\kappa\)B agonists IL1\(\beta\), anti-IgM, BAFF and sCD40L. Amongst the IGHV-M enriched clusters, C3 showed weaker responses to the majority of stimuli, and C4 was defined by a negative response to TLR7/8/9 stimulation (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021). Figure \ref{fig:clusterStimuliResponse} summarises these findings in more detail, showing responses stratified by cluster for a subset of the stimuli.

\hypertarget{the-clusters-show-differences-in-disease-dynamics}{%
\subsection{The clusters show differences in disease dynamics}\label{the-clusters-show-differences-in-disease-dynamics}}

To validate the potential biological significance of these four clusters, we investigated whether the groups showed differential \emph{in vivo} disease progression (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021). The study design was such that not all patients in the cohort were treatment - free, which confounded the analysis. For that reason, lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) and time to next treatment (TTT) were used to quantify CLL proliferative capacity, independently of treatment.

C1 and C2 showed a shorter LDT than C3 and C4, which is expected due to the differential proportions of IGHV-U and M patient samples in these groups (Figure \ref{fig:clusterLDTTTT}A). Notably, within the IGHV-M enriched clusters C3 and C4, samples in C3 showed a significantly shorter LDT (Student's t-test, p-value = 0.025).

To further validate this, we observed that TTT in the IGHV-M enriched C3 was significantly shorter than C4 and comparable to the progression dynamics of IGHV-U enriched C1 and 2 (Figure \ref{fig:clusterLDTTTT}B).

\end{figure}
The difference in disease progression between the clusters indicated that microenvironmental response represents an additional biological layer, holding information relevant to disease dynamics. To validate that these clusters were not simply an indication of any underlying genetic features, we checked whether the observed differences in progression dynamics could be explained by other prognostic markers (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021).

A multivariate Cox proportional hazard model accounting for IGHV status, trisomy 12 and TP53 in addition to the cluster assignment indicated an independent prognostic value for cluster assignment between C3 and C4 (p= 0.039, Table \ref{tab:clusterCox}).

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The clusters showed differential responses to drugs \emph{in vitro}}{The clusters showed differential responses to drugs in vitro}}\label{the-clusters-showed-differential-responses-to-drugs-in-vitro}}

The potential clinical relevance of the clusters was underlined by my observation that the samples within each group showed differential responses to drugs \emph{in vitro} (Figure \ref{fig:clusterDrugResponse}).

As expected, the IGHV-U enriched clusters C1 and 2 were more sensitive to BCR inhibition by ibrutinib, idelalisib and PRT062607, than C3 and 4. Between C1 and C2, C2 was more sensitive to a number of the drugs, including idelalisib (SYK) (p-value = 0.012), everolimus (mTOR) (p-value = 0.02) and the chemotherapeutics fludarabine (p-value = 0.031) and nutlin-3a (p-value = 0.042). Amongst C3 and C4, C3 showed lower sensitivity to everolimus (p-value = 0.051) and to fludarabine (p-value \textless{} 0.001) and nutlin-3a (p-value = 0.01). This aligns with the observation that patients in C3 have a poorer prognosis, despite most of these samples annotated as IGHV-M. C4 also showed a positive repsonse to Nf\(\kappa\)B inhibition by BAY-11-7085, and p38 MAPK inhibition by Ralimetinib.

Such differential drug response patterns suggests that microenvironmental response may reflect disease-specific CLL biology, in the same way as molecular profiling, and thus may have the potential to guide therapy decisions in future.

\hypertarget{the-clusters-are-enriched-for-different-genetic-features}{%
\subsection{The clusters are enriched for different genetic features}\label{the-clusters-are-enriched-for-different-genetic-features}}

Next we assessed differences in the molecular profiles of samples within each cluster. Visually, it appeared that certain clusters were enriched or depleted for various genetic features recurrent in CLL (Figure \ref{fig:clusterMatrix}.


\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/clusterMatrix-1} 

}

\caption{Distribution of selected genetic features (rows) within each cluster for all patient samples (columns). Where a patient sample is not annotated for a feature, this is marked in white.}\label{fig:clusterMatrix}
\end{figure}
To quantify this, I ran a multinomial model, with lasso regularisation, to predict cluster membership (C1 -4) based on the matrix of genetic features for all the patient samples (Bruch \& Giles et al 2021). The model assigned coefficients to genetic features, where a positive coefficient indicated that this feature was enriched in the cluster, and a negative coefficient indicated it was depleted.

The approach used 3-fold cross validation, selecting the optimal model using lamda min. To ensure that the resulting coefficients were robust, we selected coefficients that satisfied certain cut-offs. Coefficients were selected if they were assigned in \textgreater{} 60\% of 50 bootstrapped repeats, and were larger than 0.35. Figure \ref{fig:clusterEnrichment} shows the mean coefficients and associated standard deviation, for each genetic feature that met these criteria in each cluster.


\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{thesis_files/figure-latex/clusterEnrichment-1}

\caption{Multinomial regression with lasso penalisation to identify enrichment or depletion of genetic features within each cluster. Matrix of genetic features (p=39), and IGHV status (encoded as M = 1 and U = 0) were used to identify multivariate predictors of cluster assignment. x axis shows genetic predictors, y axis indicates value and sign of coefficient assigned to feature, for each cluster (positive coefficients are enriched in the cluster, negative coefficients are depleted). Coefficients shown are mean coefficients from 50 bootstrapped repeats and error bars represent the mean Â± standard deviation. Genetic features with \textgreater20\% missing values were excluded, and only patients with complete annotation were included in the model (n=137). Figure from Bruch \& Giles et al 2021.}\label{fig:clusterEnrichment}
\end{figure}
As we expected, IGHV status was the main feature that predicted cluster membership. Beyond IGHV status, trisomy 12 and \emph{SF3B1} mutations were enriched in C2, which showed enhanced responses to many stimuli. C4, which was associated with slow in-vivo progression, showed depletion of \emph{TP53}, \emph{ATM}, RAS/RAF mutations and gain8q.

\hypertarget{gsea-of-de-genes-between-subgroups}{%
\subsection{GSEA of DE genes between subgroups}\label{gsea-of-de-genes-between-subgroups}}

In addition to genetic features, I investigated differential expression of genes within each cluster. For n = 49 samples, RNAseq data was available for matched PBMC samples. I focused on the difference between clusters 3 and 4, for which 21 RNAseq samples were available (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021).

To quantify differential gene expression, I began by filtering out immunoglobulin genes, including genes at the heavy, light and kappa loci that encode the antigen receptor of B cells. The clusters each show differential enrichment of IGHV-M and U samples, and thus the differential expression analysis would otherwise be dominated by immunoglobulin genes that are well known to affected by this biomarker.

I followed the Deseq2 protocol using a design formula to quantify the difference between clusters, and accounting for the confounding effect of IGHV status. 87 genes were differentially expressed (adjusted p \textless{} 0.05) between C3 and 4 (Figure \ref{fig:clusterDE}).

P values adjusted using BH method. Genes are labeled where ajdusted p \textless{} 0.05. Figure from Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021.}\label{fig:clusterDE}
\end{figure}
To assign biological meaning to the differentially expressed genes, I quantified the enrichment of Hallmark pathways amongst the genes. I ranked the genes based on the Wald statistic, and then ran GSEA was using the fgsea algorithm (Figure \ref{fig:clusterGSEA}) (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021).

Several pathways were upregulated amongst samples in C3, compared to C4, indicating that these pathways may relate in some way to the shorter TTT and LDT of patients within this cluster. Pathways associated with higher disease aggression were regulated in C3 including genesets relating to stress response (Unfolded Protein Response, UV Response Up, P53 Pathway), metabolism (Oxidative Phosphorylation) and proliferation (G2M Checkpoint, MYC Targets V1, MTORC1 Signaling, E2F Targets) (Figure \ref{fig:GSEApathways}).


\begin{figure}

Genes are ranked based on Wald statistic, calculated using the Deseq2 package and GSEA performed using the fgsea algorithm. Figure from Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021.}\label{fig:clusterGSEA}
\end{figure}
In addition, C3 showed upregulation of microenvironmental signalling pathways relative to C4, including TNFa Signalling via NFKB and Interferon Gamma Response (Figure \ref{fig:GSEApathways}) (Bruch \& Giles et al.~2021). This finding underlines our hypothesis that differential activity of microenvironmental signalling, both \emph{in vivo} and \emph{ex vivo} may be relevant to disease prognosis.

\section{Summary}\label{summary}}

The screen represents an attempt to comprehensively dissect the impact of individual microenvironmental pathways on CLL viability. Our assay has enabled us to highlight key, broad spectrum signals such as IL4. Our heterogeneous cohort also reveals pathways that operate in subsets of patients, such as TLR. IL4 and TLR represent the key pathways that we focus on throughout the rest of this thesis.

In addition, this approach enables us to use microenvironmental response profiles, as an alternative to molecular profiling, to look for the existence of subgroups.

We uncovered four such subgroup with distinct response profiles and molecular properties and clinical outcomes, suggesting that microenvironmental response holds biologically significant information that may be relevant to prognosis and treatment decision making.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Organize material and present results.
\item
  Use tables, figures (but prefer visual presentation):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Tables and figures should supplement (and not duplicate) the text.
  \item
    Tables and figures should be provided with legends.
  \item
    \emph{Figure \ref{fig:graph} shows how to include and reference graphics.
    The graphic must be labelled before. Files must be in \textbf{.eps} format. You
    can do this really easily in R Markdown with \texttt{knitr::include\_graphics()}}!
  \item
    Figures can be referenced with \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(fig:\textless{}name\textgreater{})}, where \texttt{\textless{}name\textgreater{}} is the
    name of the code chunk.

  Tables and graphics may appear in the text or in the appendix, especially if
  there are many simulation results tabulated, but is also depends on the study
  and number of tables resp. figures. The key graphs and tables must appear in
  the text!
\item
  R Markdown can also supports math equations just like \emph{LaTeX}!
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Equation \eqref{eq:SpecDens} represents the ACs of a stationary
    stochastic process:}
    \begin{equation}

    \end{equation}
    \emph{where \(i=\sqrt{-1}\) is the imaginary unit, \(\lambda \in [-\pi, \pi]\) is the
    frequency and the \(\gamma_j\) are the autocovariances of \(y_t\).}
  \item
    Equations can be referenced with \texttt{\textbackslash{}@ref(eq:\textless{}name\textgreater{})}, where name is defined
