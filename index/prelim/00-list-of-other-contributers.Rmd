Unless stated otherwise, the computational methods, statistical inference and regression modelling presented here were conceptualised and performed, and interpreted by me. For the conceptualisation and implementation of statistical methods I received support from my supervisors Wolfgang Huber and Sascha Dietrich. Curation of clinical data, processing of screening data and exploratory analysis was performed by Peter Martin-Bruch. Where stated, figures were jointly produced with Peter Martin-Bruch and with input from Wolfgang Huber and Sascha Dietrich for the manuscript Bruch and Giles et al. 2021. Junyan Lu provided advice and code to support regression modelling. Ivan Berest and Christian Arnold supported processing and analysis of ATAC sequencing datasets. 

The drug - stimulus perturbation assay that forms the central dataset to this thesis was performed by Peter Martin-Bruch. Additional follow-up experiments presented in this thesis were performed by colleagues at EMBL and the Department of Medicine, University of Heidelberg:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  The Spi-B and PU.1 shRNA Knockdowns were performed by Tina Becirovic and Sophie Herbst
    \item  The immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of CLL and non-neoplastic lymph nodes were performed by Mark Kriegsmann, Katharina Kriegsmann and Christiane Zgorzelski
    \item  The Ibrutinib - IL4 - STAT6i interaction assay on CLL PMBCs  was performed by Peter-Martin Bruch
    \item  The joint RNAseq - ATACseq - Mass Spectrometry of treated CLL PMBC samples was performed by Peter-Martin Bruch and Nayara Trevisan Doimo de Azevedohe
    
For these experiments, I supported the initiation and experimental design of these follow-up experiments, in addition to analysis and interpretation of the resulting data.  
    
\end{itemize}


= I think this is good 
Now do methods and figure 5

Then review tomorrow and send off for approval
