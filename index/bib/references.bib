abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a malignancy of CD5+ B cells that is characterized by the accumulation of small, mature-appearing lymphocytes in the blood, marrow and lymphoid tissues. Signalling via surface immunoglobulin, which constitutes the major part of the B cell receptor, and several genetic alterations play a part in CLL pathogenesis, in addition to interactions between CLL cells and other cell types, such as stromal cells, T cells and nurse-like cells in the lymph nodes. The clinical progression of CLL is heterogeneous and ranges from patients who require treatment soon after diagnosis to others who do not require therapy for many years, if at all. Several factors, including the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutational status, genomic changes, patient age and the presence of comorbidities, should be considered when defining the optimal management strategies, which include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy and/or drugs targeting B cell receptor signalling or inhibitors of apoptosis, such as BCL-2. Research on the biology of CLL has profoundly enhanced our ability to identify patients who are at higher risk for disease progression and our capacity to treat patients with drugs that selectively target distinctive phenotypic or physiological features of CLL. How these and other advances have shaped our current understanding and treatment of patients with CLL is the subject of this Primer.},

While TFs may recognize different sequence patterns in different conditions, it is pragmatic to have a single generic model for each particular TF as a baseline for practical applications. Here we present the expanded and enhanced version of HOCOMOCO (http://hocomoco.autosome.ru and http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/hocomoco10), the collection of models of DNA patterns, recognized by transcription factors. HOCOMOCO now provides position weight matrix (PWM) models for binding sites of 601 human TFs and, in addition, PWMs for 396 mouse TFs. Furthermore, we introduce the largest up to date collection of dinucleotide PWM models for 86 (52) human (mouse) TFs. The update is based on the analysis of massive ChIP-Seq and HT-SELEX datasets, with the validation of the resulting models on in vivo data. To facilitate a practical application, all HOCOMOCO models are linked to gene and protein databases (Entrez Gene, HGNC, UniProt) and accompanied by precomputed score thresholds. Finally, we provide command-line tools for PWM and diPWM threshold estimation and motif finding in nucleotide sequences.},

abstract = {Many factors, including genetic and epigenetic alterations, antigenic drive and the microenvironment, are crucial in the initiation and progression of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). How will our growing understanding of CLL biology lead to the translation of therapeutic targets and prognostic markers into clinical practice? Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has several unique features that distinguish it from other cancers. Most CLL tumour cells are inert and arrested in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and there is only a small proliferative compartment; however, the progressive accumulation of malignant cells will ultimately lead to symptomatic disease. Pathogenic mechanisms have been elucidated that involve multiple external (for example, microenvironmental stimuli and antigenic drive) and internal (genetic and epigenetic) events that are crucial in the transformation, progression and evolution of CLL. Our growing understanding of CLL biology is allowing the translation of targets and biological classifiers into clinical practice.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most frequent type of leukaemia in adults, is a lymphoproliferative disorder that is characterized by the expansion of monoclonal, mature CD5+CD23+ B cells in the peripheral blood, secondary lymphoid tissues and bone marrow. CLL is an incurable disease with a heterogeneous clinical course, for which the treatment decision still relies on conventional parameters (such as clinical stage and lymphocyte doubling time). During the past 5 years, relevant advances have been made in understanding CLL biology. Indeed, substantial progress has been made in the identification of the putative cell of origin of CLL, and comprehensive studies have dissected the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of CLL. Advances in clinical management include improvements in our understanding of the prognostic value of different genetic lesions, particularly those associated with chemoresistance and progression to highly aggressive forms of CLL, and the advent of new therapies targeting crucial biological pathways. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of CLL and how these genetic insights influence clinical management and the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease. In this Review, the authors present current insights into the genetic aetiology and pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, highlighting the effect of recurrent lesions on progression, and discuss their clinical implications for management and development of novel therapeutic paradigmns.},

abstract = {Summary When B‐cell lymphocytic leukaemia (B‐CLL) cells derived from peripheral blood were cultured in vitro, a substantial proportion of them spontaneously died by apoptosis. This type of cell death is morphologically and biochemically distinct from necrosis and has previously been found to occur under physiologic and certain pathologic conditions where cell deletion appears controlled and biologically meaningful. By 30 h of culture, approximately 20% of the unfractionated B‐CLL cells were affected. There was no significant difference in the incidence of apoptosis in T‐cell depleted and undepleted cultures or when either autologous or normal human serum was used. Furthermore, seeding densities of 2 × 106 and 5 × 105 cells/ml resulted in a similar incidence of apoptosis, indicating that cell density was unlikely to be a contributing factor in producing the death. The finding that B‐CLL cells spontaneously die in vitro has at least two important implications. Firstly, previous work relating to some of the functions of B‐CLL cells and their interactions with T cells may require re‐evaluation. Secondly, an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis in this disease may have therapeutic consequences. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {PU.1 is an E26 transformation-specific family transcription factor that is required for development of the immune system. PU.1 functions at both early and late stages of lymphoid and myeloid differentiation. At least 110 direct target genes of PU.1 have been identified since its discovery in 1988. We used the published literature to determine if aspects of PU.1 function can be inferred from the identity of target genes that are directly activated. This analysis revealed that 61% of described PU.1 target genes encode extracellular proteins or transmembrane proteins, most of which are involved in cellular communication. The genes activated by PU.1 can be grouped into pathways based on function. Specific examples of cellular communication pathways regulated by PU.1 include (1) antibodies and antibody receptors, (2) cytokines and cytokine receptors regulating leukocyte growth and development, and (3) cytokines and cytokine receptors regulating inflammation. As a consequence of mutation or repression of the gene encoding PU.1, hematopoietic progenitors may be generated but there is a "failure to thrive" because they cannot interact with their environment. The loss of cellular communication caused by reduced PU.1 levels can lead to leukemia. In summary, PU.1 is a critical regulator of cellular communication in the immune system. {\textcopyright} 2011 L. Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Wroclaw, Poland.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) regulate many cellular processes and can therefore serve as readouts of the signaling and regulatory state. Yet for many TFs, the mode of action—repressing or activating transcription of target genes—is unclear. Here, we present diffTF (https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/diffTF) to calculate differential TF activity (basic mode) and classify TFs into putative transcriptional activators or repressors (classification mode). In basic mode, it combines genome-wide chromatin accessibility/activity with putative TF binding sites that, in classification mode, are integrated with RNA-seq. We apply diffTF to compare (1) mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and (2) two hematopoietic progenitor cell types. In both datasets, diffTF recovers most known biology and finds many previously unreported TFs. It classifies almost 40% of TFs based on their mode of action, which we validate experimentally. Overall, we demonstrate that diffTF recovers known biology, identifies less well-characterized TFs, and classifies TFs into transcriptional activators or repressors.},

abstract = {Although trisomy 12 (+12) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) comprises about 20% of cases, relatively little is known about its pathophysiology. These cases often demonstrate atypical morphological and immunophenotypic features, high proliferative rates, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes, and a high frequency of NOTCH1 mutation. Patients with +12 CLL have an intermediate prognosis, and show higher incidences of thrombocytopenia, Richter transformation, and other secondary cancers. Despite these important differences, relatively few transcriptional profiling studies have focused on identifying dysregulated pathways that characterize +12 CLL, and most have used a hierarchical cytogenetic classification in which cases with more than one recurrent abnormality are categorized according to the abnormality with the poorest prognosis. In this study, we sought to identify protein-coding genes whose expression contributes to the unique pathophysiology of +12 CLL. To exclude the likely confounding effects of multiple cytogenetic abnormalities on gene expression, our +12 patient cohort had +12 as the sole abnormality. We profiled samples obtained from 147 treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients. We compared cases with +12 as the only cytogenetic abnormality to cases with only del(13q), del(11q), or diploid cytogenetics using independent discovery (n=97) and validation (n=50) sets. We demonstrate that CLL cases with +12 as the sole abnormality express a unique set of activated pathways compared to other cytogenetic subtypes. Among these pathways, we identify the NFAT signaling pathway and the immune checkpoint molecule, NT5E (CD73), which may represent new therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Humoral immunity requires B cells to respond to multiple stimuli, including antigen, membrane and soluble ligands, and microbial products. Ets family transcription factors regulate many aspects of haematopoiesis, although their functions in humoral immunity are difficult to decipher as a result of redundancy between the family members. Here we show that mice lacking both PU.1 and SpiB in mature B cells do not generate germinal centers and high-affinity antibody after protein immunization. PU.1 and SpiB double-deficient B cells have a survival defect after engagement of CD40 or Toll-like receptors (TLR), despite paradoxically enhanced plasma cell differentiation. PU.1 and SpiB regulate the expression of many components of the B cell receptor signaling pathway and the receptors for CD40L, BAFF and TLR ligands. Thus, PU.1 and SpiB enable B cells to appropriately respond to environmental cues. Although important for early development, PU.1 is dispensable for mature B cell function, possibly owing to compensation by the related transcription factor SpiB. Here the authors show PU.1 and SpiB are collectively required for humoral immunity, through regulation of germinal centre formation and plasma cell differentiation.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is characterized by substantial clinical heterogeneity, despite relatively few genetic alterations. To provide a basis for studying epigenome deregulation in CLL, here we present genome-wide chromatin accessibility maps for 88 CLL samples from 55 patients measured by the ATAC-seq assay. We also performed ChIPmentation and RNA-seq profiling for ten representative samples. Based on the resulting data set, we devised and applied a bioinformatic method that links chromatin profiles to clinical annotations. Our analysis identified sample-specific variation on top of a shared core of CLL regulatory regions. IGHV mutation status—which distinguishes the two major subtypes of CLL—was accurately predicted by the chromatin profiles and gene regulatory networks inferred for IGHV-mutated versus IGHV-unmutated samples identified characteristic differences between these two disease subtypes. In summary, we discovered widespread heterogeneity in the chromatin landscape of CLL, established a community resource for studying epigenome deregulation in leukaemia and demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale chromatin accessibility mapping in cancer cohorts and clinical research. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by substantial clinical heterogeneity. Here, the authors report the genome-wide chromatin accessibility maps for 88 CLL samples from 55 patients using ATAC-seq, and 10 matched RNA-seq datasets, providing a resource for studying epigenome deregulation in CLL.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Fluorescence in situ hybridization has improved the detection of genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We used this method to identify chromosomal abnormalities in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and assessed their prognostic implications. METHODS Mononuclear cells from the blood of 325 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for deletions in chromosome bands 6q21, 11q22-23, 13q14, and 17p13; trisomy of bands 3q26, 8q24, and 12q13; and translocations involving band 14q32. Molecular cytogenetic data were correlated with clinical findings. RESULTS Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 268 of 325 cases (82 percent). The most frequent changes were a deletion in 13q (55 percent), a deletion in 11q (18 percent), trisomy of 12q (16 percent), a deletion in 17p (7 percent), and a deletion in 6q (7 percent). Five categories were defined with a statistical model: 17p deletion, 11q deletion, 12q trisomy, normal karyotype, and 13q deletion as the sole abnormality; the median survival times for patients in these groups were 32, 79, 114, 111, and 133 months, respectively. Patients in the 17p- and 11q-deletion groups had more advanced disease than those in the other three groups. Patients with 17p deletions had the shortest median treatment-free interval (9 months), and those with 13q deletions had the longest (92 months). In multivariate analysis, the presence or absence of a 17p deletion, the presence or absence of an 11q deletion, age, Binet stage, the serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and the white-cell count gave significant prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS Genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia are important independent predictors of disease progression and survival. These findings have implications for the design of risk-adapted treatment strategies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the VH mutation status and genomic aberrations (13q-, +12q, 11q-, 17p-) identify distinct prognostic subgroups. The aim was to elucidate biologic mechanisms through which these genetic markers may exert their pathogenic influence. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-four genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, B-cell activation, and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in 82 CLL cases constituting prototypic genetic CLL subgroups as defined by the VH mutation status and the genomic aberrations 13q-, +12, 11q-, and 17p-. RESULTS The VH mutation subgroups were characterized by a differential expression of the BCR associated genes ZAP70 and PI3K. Among the subgroups defined by genomic aberrations, there was a deregulation of candidate genes from the affected critical genomic regions such as CDK4 (up), ATM (down), and TP53 (down) in the groups +12, 11q-, and 17p-, respectively. Additionally, the genomic subgroups were characterized by a significant deregulation of cell cycle and apoptosis regulators: AKT (up) in 13q, E2F1 (up) in +12, MYC (up) and BCL-2 (down) in 17p-, and CCND3 (down) in 11q- as well as 17p-. The 17p- subgroup showed an additional down-regulation of BCR-associated genes such as SYK and PI3K. CONCLUSION The characteristic gene expression patterns observed implicate a differential regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and BCR signaling in the genetic subgroups illustrating distinct pathomechanisms and are evidence for a gene dosage effect being operative in CLL. These findings link the biologic diversity and clinical heterogeneity of CLL.},

abstract = {Disruption of the interaction of bromo and extraterminal (BET) proteins with acetylated histones using small molecule inhibitors suppresses Myc-driven cancers and TLR-induced inflammation in mouse models. The predominant mechanism of BET inhibitor action is to suppress BET-mediated recruitment of positive transcription elongation factor b and, thus, transcription elongation. We investigated the effects of BET inhibitor I-BET151 on transcriptional responses to TLR4 and TNF in primary human monocytes and also on responses to cytokines IFN-$\beta$, IFN-$\gamma$, IL-4, and IL-10, which activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and are important for monocyte polarization and inflammatory diseases. I-BET151 suppressed TLR4- and TNF-induced IFN responses by diminishing both autocrine IFN-$\beta$ expression and transcriptional responses to IFN-$\beta$. I-BET151 inhibited cytokine-induced transcription of STAT targets in a gene-specific manner without affecting STAT activation or recruitment. This inhibition was independent of Myc or other upstream activators. IFN-stimulated gene transcription is regulated primarily at the level of transcription initiation. Accordingly, we found that I-BET151 suppressed the recruitment of transcriptional machinery to the CXCL10 promoter and an upstream enhancer. Our findings suggest that BET inhibition reduces inflammation partially through suppressing cytokine activity and expands the understanding of the inhibitory and potentially selective immunosuppressive effects of inhibiting BET proteins.},

abstract = {Many functional consequences of mutations on tumor phenotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are unknown. This may be in part due to a scarcity of information on the proteome of CLL. We profiled the proteome of 117 CLL patient samples with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and integrated the results with genomic, transcriptomic, ex vivo drug response and clinical outcome data. We found trisomy 12, IGHV mutational status, mutated SF3B1, trisomy 19, del(17)(p13), del(11)(q22.3), mutated DDX3X, and MED12 to influence protein expression (FDR < 5%). Trisomy 12 and IGHV status were the major determinants of protein expression variation in CLL as shown by principal component analysis (1055 and 542 differentially expressed proteins, FDR=5%). Gene set enrichment analyses of CLL with trisomy 12 implicated BCR/PI3K/AKT signaling as a tumor driver. These findings were supported by analyses of protein abundance buffering and protein complex formation, which identified limited protein abundance buffering and an upregulated protein complex involved in BCR, AKT, MAPK and PI3K signaling in trisomy 12 CLL. A survey of proteins associated with trisomy 12/IGHV-independent drug response linked STAT2 protein expression with response to kinase inhibitors including BTK and MEK inhibitors. STAT2 was upregulated in U-CLL, trisomy 12 CLL and required for chemokine/cytokine signaling (interferon response). This study highlights the importance of protein abundance data as a non-redundant layer of information in tumor biology, and provides a protein expression reference map for CLL.},

abstract = {Key Points • IL-4 treatment augments sIgM expression and subsequent downstream signalling in a JAK3/STAT6 dependent manner within CLL samples. • IL-4 exposure partially opposes the activity of Bruton tyrosine kinase or PI3K inhibitors on sIgM-mediated signalling. Kinase inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) are now prominent in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have focused here on interleukin 4 (IL-4), a cytokine that protects normal and malignant B cells from apoptosis and increases surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM) expression on murine splenic B cells. First, we have demonstrated that IL-4 treatment increased sIgM expression in vitro on peripheral blood B cells obtained from healthy individuals. In CLL, IL-4 target genes are overexpressed in cells purified from the lymph nodes of patients compared with cells derived from matched blood and bone marrow samples. As for normal B cells, IL-4 increased sIgM expression on CLL cells in vitro, especially in samples expressing unmutated V-genes. IL-4-induced sIgM expression was associated with increased receptor signalling activity, measured by anti-IgM-induced calcium mobilization, and with increased expression of CD79B messenger RNA and protein, and the "mature" glycoform of sIgM. Importantly, the ability of the BCR-associated kinase inhibitors idelalisib and ibrutinib, approved for treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies, to inhibit anti-IgM-induced signalling was reduced following IL-4 pretreatment in samples from the majority of patients. In contrast to stimulatory effects on sIgM, IL-4 decreased CXCR4 and CXCR5 expression; therefore, CLL cells, particularly within the progressive unmutated V-gene subset, may harness the ability of IL-4 to promote BCR signalling and B-cell retention within lymph nodes. Effects of IL-4 were mediated via JAK3/STAT6 and we propose a potential role for JAK inhibitors in combination with BCR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CLL. (Blood. 2016;127(24):3015-3025)},
