abstract = {Malignant B lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients maintain the capacity to respond to CD40 ligation, among other microenvironmental stimuli. In this study, we show that (i) leukemic CLL cells stimulated with the soluble form of CD40L in vitro show differential responses in terms of upregulation of surface markers (CD95 and CD80) and induction of chemokines (CCL22 and CCL17) expression/secretion, and that (ii) these changes are mirrored by a distinct activation of intracellular signalling pathways including increase in IKKalpha/beta phosphorylation and upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins (BCL-2 and MCL-1). CLL patients can then be segregated into two distinct functional subsets. We defined the responsive subset of cases CD40L dependent, considering the capacity to respond as a sign of persistent need of this stimulation for the leukemic expansion. Conversely, we named the unresponsive cases CD40L independent, considering them less dependent on this microenvironmental signal, presumably because of a higher autonomous proliferative and survival potential. Importantly, we report that (iii) the two functional subsets show an opposite clinical outcome, with CD40L-independent cases having a shorter time to progression. This indicates that the functional differences observed in vitro may reflect a different leukemic potential in vivo likely responsible for a distinct clinical course. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Time to next treatment (TTNT) is an emerging endpoint in clinical studies of primary cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL), with utility as a surrogate marker for the “duration of clinical benefit”. TTNT provides a highly clinically meaningful endpoint that uniquely reflects not only the duration of treatment efficacy on disease and symptom control, but also incorporates the patient experience by accounting for patient compliance and tolerance to the studied therapy(s). Given the distinct challenges of pin-pointing the exact date of progression in patients with multi-compartmental CTCL, TTNT overcomes many of the shortcomings of conventional, disease-focused, clinical endpoints in primary CTCL research. Although widely accepted in clinical research for numerous other incurable malignancies, TTNT currently lacks a standardised definition. In this paper, we describe the value of TTNT as a clinical endpoint, review the applications of TTNT in primary CTCL research, and propose a standardised definition of TTNT to be applied in future clinical research of primary CTCL therapies.},

abstract = {A subset of B cells expressing the CD5 marker, a 67 KD molecule, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. To study the immunoglobulin repertoire of CD5+ B cells we investigated chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) cells, since the majority of the malignant clones express CD5. CLL were induced to secrete their IgM in vitro by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and the supernatants screened for binding to a panel of autoantigens. Twelve out of 14 CLL clones were autoreactive, binding to Fc of IgG, ssDNA, dsDNA, histones, cardiolipin, or cytoskeletal components. Many also bound to more than one antigen tested for, showing multispecificity. Our data suggest that a high proportion of CD5+ B cells are programmed to secrete multispecific autoantibodies. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are highly treatable conditions occurring primarily in older patients. Lower survival among older people has been reported in both conditions, but newer treatments may change both the overall survival rate and the relative risk associated with aging. Here, we examine survival for patients with CLL and CML in the United States (US) and England. METHODS Patients with CLL and CML were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (US) and National Cancer Registry (England). Five-year relative survival was calculated by major age group. Excess hazard ratios (EHR) by age were calculated for each condition, and multivariable analysis was performed to adjust for the following potential confounders: gender, race or ethnic group (US only), period of diagnosis, and a measure of socioeconomic deprivation (England only). RESULTS Five-year relative survival increased for both CLL and CML in both England and the US between 1996-2000 and 2006-2010. However, relative age-related disparities persisted. For CLL, the EHR for death was 9.44 (7.84-11.36) in the US and 6.14 (5.65-6.68) in England for ages 85+ compared to ages 55-64. For CML, the EHR was 3.52 (3.17-3.90) in the US and 4.54 (4.13-4.98) in England for ages 75+ compared to ages 45-64. CONCLUSIONS Survival improved for patients with chronic leukemias in the early 21st century. However, age-related disparities persist, despite clinical trial evidence that treatment in older adults with chronic leukemia can be safe and effective. Further research to determine the reasons for the lower survival in older patients and greater awareness of this problem may improve survival for older patients with chronic leukemia.},

abstract = {Responses to single-agent ibrutinib (IBR) or venetoclax (VEN) in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) or Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) are often incomplete suggesting drug combinations are needed to overcome de novo and acquired resistance. We previously reported synergistic cytotoxicity for the IBR+VEN combination in CLL/MCL cells ex vivo and have initiated an IBR+VEN clinical trial in MCL (NCT02419560). However, ex vivo analysis of patient samples showed de novo resistance even to the IBR+VEN combination in some samples, consistent with recent clinical experience (Tam et al. N Engl J Med, 2018). We noted that sensitivity to IBR+VEN was lower in CLL cells showing an "activation" phenotype (CD5+/19+/69+) that can be induced by extracellular factors in vivo, suggesting that the microenvironment could induce drug tolerance in the cancer cells.This was supported by our finding that ex vivo exposure of CLL/MCL samples to a mixture of microenvironmental agonists (CpG-ODN, sCD40L, and IL10; "agonist mix") induced significant loss of sensitivity to IBR+VEN (Jayappa et al. Blood Adv., 2017). Here we show that various microenvironmental agonists, including of innate immunity, are able to reduce sensitivity to IBR+VEN as well as other pro-apoptotic drugs, generating a multi-drug tolerant phenotype.To explore drug tolerance, we performed flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis induced by IBR+VEN in CD5+/19+cancer cells in CLL/MCL PBMCs cultured with agonists of TLRs, NOD1/2, CD40, and IL10R and various stromal cells. Tolerance to IBR+VEN as determined by resistance to apoptosis was noted in most samples cultured with TLR9 agonist CpG-ODN, sCD40L, or Jurkat cells expressing CD40L. IL10 and HUVEC induced modest levels of drug tolerance in a few CLL/MCL samples, and TLR1/2, TLR7, and NOD1/2 agonists were effective only in MCL samples.Prior exposure to CpG-ODN enhanced the ability of sCD40L to induce proliferation and drug tolerance and vice versa in CLL/MCL, predicting mutually reinforcing interactions in vivo. We noted that CLL cells exposed to CpG-ODN displayed higher levels of CD40 and downstream signaling proteins (TRAF2, RelB, and p100/52). Conversely, CD40L induced a modest increase in NF-kB transcription factors, providing a possible mechanism for mutual reinforcement.Using flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis, we noted tolerance to several pro-apoptotic agents (bendamustine, fludarabine, and inhibitors of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL) including IBR+VEN in CD5+/19+cells from CLL samples treated with agonist mix, showing development of multi-drug tolerance in these cells. CpG-ODN or agonist mix induced NFkB-dependent over-expression of pro-survival proteins (Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL), and increased ratio of these to cognate pro-apoptotic proteins. This increased expression of pro-survival proteins underlies the multi-drug tolerant phenotype. Consistently, multi-drug tolerance was rescued with inhibitors of NFkB (BMS345541 or Bortezomib) or drug combinations simultaneously inhibiting multiple anti-apoptotic proteins (inhibition of Mcl-1 with Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL).CLL cells with activation phenotype (CD5+/19+/69+) in patient PBMCs cultured without the agonist mix also showed tolerance to several apoptotic protein inhibitors ex vivo, and this was also effectively rescued with NF-kB inhibition or combination of apoptotic protein inhibitors ex vivo. These results suggest that the cancer cells with activation phenotype exist in vivo anddisplay multi-drug tolerant phenotype consistent with the drug tolerance induced by agonist mix ex vivo.In conclusion, several microenvironmental factors, particularly agonists of TLR9 and CD40, induce tolerance to IBR+VEN and cell proliferation in CLL/MCL, and response to these agonists is enhanced by combinatorial exposure. These agonists generate tolerance to several apoptosis-inducing agents beyond IBR+VEN. This microenvironment-induced multi-drug tolerance is mediated by NFkB dependent over-expression of multiple pro-survival proteins. Inhibitors of NFkB, or drug combinations targeting multiple pro-survival proteins, overcame multi-drug tolerance in agonist mix-treated samples and in CD69+CLL cells in patient PBMCs that represent multi-drug tolerant cells in vivo. Thus, more complete and durable responses might be achieved in MCL/CLL with therapies that target multi-drug tolerant persister cells.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients exhibit a variable clinical course. To investigate the association between clinicobiologic features and responsiveness of CLL cells to anti-IgM stimulation, we evaluated gene expression changes and modifications in cell-cycle distribution, proliferation, and apoptosis of IgVH mutated (M) and unmutated (UM) samples upon BCR cross-linking. Unsupervised analysis highlighted a different response profile to BCR stimulation between UM and M samples. Supervised analysis identified several genes modulated exclusively in the UM cases upon BCR cross-linking. Functional gene groups, including signal transduction, transcription, cell-cycle regulation, and cytoskeleton organization, were up-regulated upon stimulation in UM cases. Cell-cycle and proliferation analyses confirmed that IgM cross-linking induced a significant progression into the G1 phase and a moderate increase of proliferative activity exclusively in UM patients. Moreover, we observed only a small reduction in the percentage of subG0/1 cells, without changes in apoptosis, in UM cases; contrariwise, a significant increase of apoptotic levels was observed in stimulated cells from M cases. These results document that a differential genotypic and functional response to BCR ligation between IgVH M and UM cases is operational in CLL, indicating that response to antigenic stimulation plays a pivotal role in disease progression.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a progressive malignancy of mature B-cells that involves the peripheral blood (PB), lymph nodes (LNs) and bone marrow (BM). Although the majority of CLL cells are in a resting state, small populations of proliferating cells exist; however, the anatomical site of active cell proliferation remains to be definitively determined. Based on findings that CLL cells in LNs have increased expression of B-cell activation genes, we tested the hypothesis that the fraction of ‘newly born' cells would be highest in the LNs. Using a deuterium oxide (2H) in vivo labeling method in which patients consumed deuterated (heavy) water (2H2O), we determined CLL cell kinetics in concurrently obtained samples from LN, PB and BM. The LN was identified as the anatomical site harboring the largest fraction of newly born cells, compared to PB and BM. In fact, the calculated birth rate in the LN reached as high a 3.3% of the clone per day. Subdivision of the bulk CLL population by flow cytometry identified the subpopulation with the CXCR4dimCD5bright phenotype as containing the highest proportion of newly born cells within each compartment, including the LN, identifying this subclonal population as an important target for novel treatment approaches.},

B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) cells were treated in vitro with CD40-ligand (CD40L) (CD154) or the protein kinase C modulator Bryostatin-1, exploring the effects on: (a) sensitivity to apoptosis induction by chemotherapeutic drugs (fludarabine, dexamethasone) or anti-Fas antibody; (b) expression of apoptosis-regulatory proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X, Mcl-1, Bax, Bak, BAG-1, Flip, XIAP); (c) expression of cell surface co-stimulatory antigens (CD80 [B7.1]; CD54 [ICAM-1]; CD70); and (d) expression of immune modulatory receptors (CD27, CD40, CD95 [Fas]). CD40L and Bryostatin decreased both spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis in most B-CLL specimens tested. Apoptosis resistance was associated with CD40L- and Bryostatin-induced elevations in the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. CD40L also induced striking increases in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL in B-CLLs. CD40L stimulated increases in the surface expression of CD40, CD54, CD69, CD70, CD80 and CD95, whereas Bryostatin induced expression of CD40, CD54, CD69 and CD95 but not the co-stimulatory molecules CD70 and CD80. Despite elevations in the expression of CD95 (Fas), anti-Fas antibodies failed to induce apoptosis of CD40L- and Bryostatin-treated B-CLL cells. This Fas-resistance was associated with increased expression of the Fas-antagonist Flip in CD40L-treated, and with elevations in the caspase inhibitor XIAP in Bryostatin-treated B-CLLs. The potential anti-apoptotic properties of CD40L and Bryostatin should be taken into consideration when employing these agents in clinical trials involving patients with B-CLL.},

abstract = {We present an individualized systems medicine (ISM) approach to optimize cancer drug therapies one patient at a time. ISM is based on (i) molecular profiling and ex vivo drug sensitivity and resistance testing (DSRT) of patients' cancer cells to 187 oncology drugs, (ii) clinical implementation of therapies predicted to be effective, and (iii) studying consecutive samples from the treated patients to understand the basis of resistance. Here, application of ISM to 28 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) uncovered five major taxonomic drug-response subtypes based on DSRT profiles, some with distinct genomic features (e.g., MLL gene fusions in subgroup IV and FLT3 -ITD mutations in subgroup V). Therapy based on DSRT resulted in several clinical responses. After progression under DSRT-guided therapies, AML cells displayed significant clonal evolution and novel genomic changes potentially explaining resistance, whereas ex vivo DSRT data showed resistance to the clinically applied drugs and new vulnerabilities to previously ineffective drugs. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we demonstrate an ISM strategy to optimize safe and effective personalized cancer therapies for individual patients as well as to understand and predict disease evolution and the next line of therapy. This approach could facilitate systematic drug repositioning of approved targeted drugs as well as help to prioritize and de-risk emerging drugs for clinical testing. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Association for Cancer Research.},

We assessed the clinical and biological significance of LDT in 848 CLL patients in a real-life setting and the context of new biomarkers and effective therapy. A short LDT (≤12 months) was enriched for adverse biomarkers. Patients with a rapid LDT did need therapy shortly after diagnosis (median 23 months vs. not reached; p < 0.001) and had a poorer overall survival (median 95 months vs. not reached p < 0.001). LDT, IGHV mutational status, Beta-2 microglobulin, and Rai clinical stage were independent predictors for time to first treatment in the whole series and in Binet stage A patients. No correlation was observed between LDT and response to chemoimmunotherapy. However, a short LDT along with age ≥65 years, high-risk FISH (del(17p), del(11q)), unmutated IGHV, increased Beta-2 microglobulin, and TP53 mutations predicted short survival. Moreover, the prognostic significance of LDT was independent of the CLL-IPI and the Barcelona/Brno prognostic model. LDT remains an important outcome marker in the modern CLL era and should be incorporated into the clinical assessment and stratification of CLL patients.},

abstract = {We examined the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain variable region genes (VH genes) used by leukemia cells of 1220 unrelated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We found 1188 (97%) expressed Ig encoded by a single Ig VH subgroup, the most common of which was VH3 (571 or 48.1%), followed by VH1 (319 or 26.8%) and VH4 (241 or 20.2%). Using allele-specific primers, we found 13.8% of all samples (n = 164) used one major VH1-69 allele, designated 51p1, 163 of which were not somatically mutated. For these cases, there was marked restriction in the structure of the Ig third complementarity determining regions (CDR3s), which were encoded by a small number of unmutated D and JH gene segments. Strikingly, 15 of the 163 cases had virtually identical CDR3s encoded by the second reading frame of D3-16 and JH3. Further analysis revealed that each of these 15 samples used the same unmutated Ig kappa light-chain gene, namely A27. These data reveal that approximately 1.3% (15/1220) of all patients had leukemia cells that expressed virtually identical Ig. This finding provides compelling evidence that the Ig expressed by CLL B cells are highly selected and not representative of the Ig expressed by naive B cells. {\textcopyright} 2004 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Chemoimmunotherapy has been the standard of care for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) over the last decade. Advances in monoclonal antibody technology have resulted in the development of newer generations of anti-CD20 antibodies with improved therapeutic effectiveness. In parallel, our knowledge about the distinctive biological characteristics of CLL has progressively deepened and has revealed the importance of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and upregulated antiapoptotic proteins for survival and expansion of malignant cell clones. This knowledge provided the basis for development of novel targeted agents that revolutionized treatment of CLL. Ibrutinib and idelalisib inhibit the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) delta, respectively, thus interfering with supportive signals coming from the microenvironment via the BCR. These drugs induce egress of CLL cells from secondary lymphoid organs and remarkably improve clinical outcomes, especially for patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes or with p53 abnormalities that do not benefit from classical treatment schemes. Latest clinical trial results have established ibrutinib with or without anti-CD20 antibodies as the preferred first-line treatment for most CLL patients, which will reduce the use of chemoimmunotherapy in the imminent future. Further advances are achieved with venetoclax, a BH3-mimetic that specifically inhibits the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 protein and thus causes rapid apoptosis of CLL cells, which translates into deep and prolonged clinical responses including high rates of minimal residual disease negativity. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of targeted CLL therapies, including new combination schemes, novel BTK and PI3K inhibitors, spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, and cellular immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Background On the basis of promising results that were reported in several phase 2 trials, we investigated whether the addition of the monoclonal antibody rituximab to first-line chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide would improve the outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Methods Treatment-naive, physically fit patients (aged 30-81 years) with CD20-positive chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to receive six courses of intravenous fludarabine (25 mg/m2 per day) and cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m2 per day) for the first 3 days of each 28-day treatment course with or without rituximab (375 mg/m2 on day 0 of first course, and 500 mg/m2 on day 1 of second to sixth courses) in 190 centres in 11 countries. Investigators and patients were not masked to the computer-generated treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00281918. Findings 408 patients were assigned to fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (chemoimmunotherapy group) and 409 to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (chemotherapy group); all patients were analysed. At 3 years after randomisation, 65 of patients in the chemoimmunotherapy group were free of progression compared with 45 in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}56 [95 CI 0{\textperiodcentered}46-0{\textperiodcentered}69], p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001); 87 were alive versus 83, respectively (0{\textperiodcentered}67 [0{\textperiodcentered}48-0{\textperiodcentered}92]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}01). Chemoimmunotherapy was more frequently associated with grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (136 [34] of 404 vs 83 [21] of 396; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001) and leucocytopenia (97 [24] vs 48 [12]; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Other side-effects, including severe infections, were not increased. There were eight (2) treatment-related deaths in the chemoimmunotherapy group compared with ten (3) in the chemotherapy group. Interpretation Chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab improves progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Moreover, the results suggest that the choice of a specific first-line treatment changes the natural course of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

abstract = {Purpose: In cancer cells, the epigenome is often deregulated, and inhibition of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family of bromodomain-containing proteins is a novel epigenetic therapeutic approach. Preliminary results of an ongoing phase I trial have reported promising activity and tolerability with the new BET bromodomain inhibitor OTX015. Experimental Design: We assessed the preclinical activity of OTX015 as single agent and in combination in mature B-cell lymphoma models and performed in vitro and in vivo experiments to identify the mechanism of action and the genetic features associated with sensitivity to the compound. Results: OTX015 showed antiproliferative activity in a large panel of cell lines derived from mature B-cell lymphoid tumors with median IC50 of 240 nmol/L, without signi ficant differences among the different histotypes. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that OTX015 targeted NFKB/TLR/JAK/STAT signaling pathways, MYC- and E2F1-regulated genes, cell-cycle regulation, and chromatin structure. OTX015 presented in vitro synergism with several anticancer agents, especially with mTOR and BTK inhibitors. Gene expression signatures associated with different degrees of sensitivity to OTX015 were identified. Although OTX015 was mostly cytostatic, the compound induced apoptosis in a genetically defined subgroup of cells, derived from activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, bearing wtTP53, mutations in MYD88, and CD79B or CARD11. Conclusions: Together with the data coming from the ongoing phase I study, the in vitro and in vivo data presented here provide the basis for further clinical investigation of OTX015 as single agent and in combination therapies.},

abstract = {The discovery that lymphocyte subpopulations participate in distinct components of the immune response focused attention onto the origins and function of lymphocytes more than 40 years ago. Studies in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated that B and T lymphocytes were responsible primarily for the basic functions of antibody production and cell-mediated immune responses, respectively. The decades that followed have witnessed a continuum of unfolding complexities in B-cell development, subsets, and function that could not have been predicted. Some of the landmark discoveries that led to our current understanding of B lymphocytes as the source of protective innate and adaptive antibodies are highlighted in this essay. The phenotypic and functional diversity of B lymphocytes, their regulatory roles independent of antibody production, and the molecular events that make this lineage unique are also considered. Finally, perturbations in B-cell development that give rise to certain types of congenital immunodeficiency, leukemia/lymphoma, and autoimmune disease are discussed in the context of normal B-cell development and selection. Despite the significant advances that have been made at the cellular and molecular levels, there is much more to learn, and cross-disciplinary studies in hematology and immunology will continue to pave the way for new discoveries. 1570-15801 {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.},

To address this lack of data, we have developed a dynamic in vitromodel inwhichCLL cells experience shear forces equivalent to those in capillary beds and are made to flow through capillary-like hollow fibers lined with endothelial cells. CLL cells treatedin thisway increased their expression of CD62 Land CXCR4 (both P<.0001) and of CD49d and CD5 (both P = .003) directly as a result of the shear force. Furthermore, CLL cells migrated through the endothelium into the "extravascular" space (mean migration, 1.37% ± 2.14%; n = 21). Migrated CLL cells had significantly higher expression of CD49d (P =.02), matrix metallopeptidase-9 (P = .004), CD38 (P = .009), CD80 (P = .04), and CD69 (P = .04) compared with CLL cells that remained in the circulation. The degree of migration observed strongly correlated with CD49d expression (r2, 0.47; P = .01), and treatment with the CD49d-blocking antibody natalizumab resulted in significantly decreased migration (P = .01). Taken together, our data provide evidence for a novel, dynamic, and tractable in vitro model of lymphocyte migration and confirm that CD49d is a critical regulator of this process in CLL {\textcopyright} 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.},

@article{Burger2000,
abstract = {ABSTRACT A subset of blood cells from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) spontaneously differentiates in vitro into large, round, or fibroblast-like adherent cells that display stromal cell markers, namely vimentin and STRO-1. These cells also express stromal cell–derived factor-1 (SDF-1), a CXC chemokine that ordinarily is secreted by marrow stromal cells. Leukemia B cells attach to these blood-derived adherent cells, down-modulate their receptors for SDF-1 (CXCR4), and are protected from undergoing spontaneous apoptosis in vitro. Neutralizing antibodies to SDF-1 inhibit this effect. Moreover, the rapid deterioration in the survival of CLL B cells, when separated from such cells, is mitigated by exogenous SDF-1. This chemokine also results in the rapid down-modulation of CXCR4 and activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein-kinase (ERK 1/2) by CLL B cells in vitro. It is concluded that the blood of patients with CLL contains cells that can differentiate into adherent nurse-like cells that protect leukemia cells from undergoing spontaneous apoptosis through an SDF-1–dependent mechanism. In addition to its recently recognized role in CLL B-cell migration, SDF-1–mediated CLL B-cell activation has to be considered a new mechanism involved in the microenvironmental regulation of CLL B-cell survival.},

abstract = {The terminal differentiation of antibody-secreting cells is controlled by a network of antagonistic transcription factors and, although it is highly complex, this process can be explained by a simple probabilistic differentiation process. The regulation of antibody production is linked to the generation and maintenance of plasmablasts and plasma cells from their B cell precursors. Plasmablasts are the rapidly produced and short-lived effector cells of the early antibody response, whereas plasma cells are the long-lived mediators of lasting humoral immunity. An extraordinary number of control mechanisms, at both the cellular and molecular levels, underlie the regulation of this essential arm of the immune response. Despite this complexity, the terminal differentiation of B cells can be described as a simple probabilistic process that is governed by a central gene-regulatory network and modified by environmental stimuli.},

Methods: Relevant studies were identified upon literature review, which were combined with our clinical and institutional experience. Results: Fludarabine-based regimens result in an overall response rate of approximately 95% and of untreated CLL patients. Fludarabine also causes potentially irreversible grade 3 or 4 cytopenias and infection in the majority of patients. Furthermore, future hematopoietic cell mobilization may be difficult and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia occur in at least 3% of patients. Conclusion: Fludarabine should be used judiciously in older patients, and avoided entirely in patients with renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood cell counts with appropriate dose reduction/omission is vital.

abstract = {B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common human leukemia. 13q14 deletions are most common chromosomal alterations in CLL. We previously reported that miR-15/16 is a target of 13q14 deletions and plays a tumor suppressor role by targeting BCL2. Because DLEU7 is located near miR-15/16 and is also positioned within a minimal deleted region, we investigated whether DLEU7 could also play a tumor suppressor role. Recent studies of transgenic mouse models demonstrated the importance of the nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathway in CLL. To examine the possible role of DLEU7 in CLL, we investigated the effect of DLEU7 expression on NF-$\kappa$B and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) activity. We found that DLEU7 functions as a potent NF-$\kappa$B and NFAT inhibitor by physically interacting and inhibiting TACI and BCMA, members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family involved in B-CLL. In addition, DLEU7 expression in A549 lung cancer cells resulted in a decrease in S phase and increased apoptosis. The results suggest that loss of DLEU7 may cooperate with the loss of miR-15/16 in the pathogenesis of CLL. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The American Society of Hematology.},

These Th cells activated autologous CLL cell proliferation in vitro and in human → mouse xenograft experiments. Moreover, CLL cells were efficient antigen-presenting cells that could endocytose and process complex proteins through antigen uptake pathways, including the B cell receptor. Activation of CLL cells by Th cells was contact and CD40L dependent. The results suggest that CLL is driven by ongoing immune responses related to Th cell–CLL cell interaction. We propose that Th cells support malignant B cells and that they could be targeted in the treatment of CLL.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a frequent hematological neoplasm in which underlying epigenetic alterations are only partially understood. Here, we analyze the reference epigenome of seven primary CLLs and the regulatory chromatin landscape of 107 primary cases in the context of normal B cell differentiation. We identify that the CLL chromatin landscape is largely influenced by distinct dynamics during normal B cell maturation. Beyond this, we define extensive catalogues of regulatory elements de novo reprogrammed in CLL as a whole and in its major clinico-biological subtypes classified by IGHV somatic hypermutation levels. We uncover that IGHV-unmutated CLLs harbor more active and open chromatin than IGHV-mutated cases. Furthermore, we show that de novo active regions in CLL are enriched for NFAT, FOX and TCF/LEF transcription factor family binding sites. Although most genetic alterations are not associated with consistent epigenetic profiles, CLLs with MYD88 mutations and trisomy 12 show distinct chromatin configurations. Furthermore, we observe that non-coding mutations in IGHV-mutated CLLs are enriched in H3K27ac-associated regulatory elements outside accessible chromatin. Overall, this study provides an integrative portrait of the CLL epigenome, identifies extensive networks of altered regulatory elements and sheds light on the relationship between the genetic and epigenetic architecture of the disease.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has a complex pattern of driver mutations and much of its clinical diversity remains unexplained. We devised a method for simultaneous subgroup discovery across multiple data types and applied it to genomic, transcriptomic, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug response data from 217 patients with CLL. We uncovered a biological axis of heterogeneity strongly associated with clinical behavior and orthogonal to known biomarkers. We validated its presence and clinical relevance in four independent cohorts (n = 547 patients). We found that this axis captures the proliferative drive (PD) of CLL cells, as it associates with lymphocyte doubling rate, global hypomethylation, accumulation of driver aberrations and response to pro-proliferative stimuli.

abstract = {Background VLA-4 and CD38 predict a poor clinical outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We used CLL samples with discordant VLA-4/CD38 risk to address their individual roles in human bone marrow infiltration (BM), CLL cell homing to murine BM, and in supportive CLL cell-stromal cell interactions. Methods VLA-4, CD38, and Ki-67 expression was measured in CLL cells from peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) aspirates. CLL BM infiltration rates, routinely determined by Pathology, were correlated to VLA-4 and CD38 expression. Short-term homing capacity of CLL cells was evaluated by adoptive transfer experiments. CLL cell viability and adhesion in stromal cell co-culture was determined. Results About 20% of CLL samples in our cohort displayed discordant VLA-4 and CD38 risk, with either high VLA-4 and low CD38 risk or vice versa. Using particularly such samples, we observed that VLA-4, and not CD38, was responsible for recirculation of CLL cells to murine BM. Human BM infiltration was also significantly higher in patients with high VLA-4 risk but not high CD38 risk. However, both molecules acted as independent prognostic markers. While both VLA-4 and CD38 expression were increased in BM-derived CLL cells, and VLA-4+ and CD38+ subpopulations showed enriched Ki-67 expression, VLA-4 did not contribute to CLL cell protection by stromal cells in vitro. Conclusions Our data argue for a prominent role of VLA-4 but not CD38 expression in the homing of CLL cells to BM niches and in human BM infiltration,but only a limited role in their protection by stromal cells.},

The ultimate goal of cancer systems biology nowadays is thus, unraveling the mechanisms of action, regulation and control in the complex tangle of biochemical and biophysical interactions behind cancer biology. An outstanding example of this trend is given in the paper by Kessler and coworkers (2013). On this work, the authors combine ideas from gene expression profiling for phenotypic classification (Hedenfalk, 2002; Subramanian et al., 2005), of signaling pathways (Haynes et al., 2013; Leiserson et al., 2013) and of network modularity (Hintze and Adami, 2008; Jiang et al., 2008), in order to show how molecular physiology (i.e., understanding the physiological mechanisms of disease from a molecular standpoint) may have many clues leading to better prognosis and treatment of cancer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Hernandez-Lemus.},

To investigate the possibility that PU.1 or Spi-B or both share overlapping roles with Ets-1 or Elf-1, PU.1+/−Ets-1−/−, PU.1+/−Elf-1−/−, and Spi-B−/−Ets-1−/− animals were generated. No blood cell defects were observed in these animals except those previously reported for Ets-1−/− mice. Therefore, no genetic overlap was detected between PU.1 or Spi-B with Ets-1 or Elf-1. In contrast, the results confirmed functional redundancy for PU.1 and Spi-B in that PU.1+/−Spi-B−/− bone marrow progenitors yielded smaller colonies in methylcellulose cultures than did wild-type, PU.1+/− or Spi-B−/−progenitors. In addition, PU.1+/−Spi-B+/+, PU.1+/−Spi-B+/−, and PU.1+/− Spi-B−/− mice displayed extramedullary splenic hematopoiesis. In summary, PU.1 and Spi-B regulate common target genes required for proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors or their committed descendants, whereas Ets-1 or Elf-1 do not appear to regulate shared target genes with PU.1 or Spi-B.},

Although durable remissions are being seen in many patients with these agents, it is becoming apparent that some patients with high genomic risk disease will relapse. Next-generation sequencing in patients as well as in vitro models is affording us the opportunity to understand the biology behind these relapses, which is the first step to designing rational therapies to prevent and treat targeted therapy-resistant CLL. These strategies are critical, as these relapses can be very difficult to manage, and a coordinated effort to put these patients on clinical trials will be required to efficiently determine the optimal therapies for these patients. In this review, we will describe mechanisms of resistance, both proven and hypothesized, for idelalisib, ibrutinib, and venetoclax, describe patterns of resistance that have been described with ibrutinib, and discuss potential strategies for management of disease resistant to these drugs as well as potential strategies to prevent resistance.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells survive longer in vivo than in vitro, suggesting that the tissue microenvironment provides prosurvival signals to tumor cells. Primary and secondary lymphoid tissues are involved in the pathogenesis of CLL, and the role of these tissue microenvironments has not been explored completely. To elucidate host-tumor interactions, we performed gene expression profiling (GEP) of purified CLL cells from peripheral blood (PB; n = 20), bone marrow (BM; n = 18), and lymph node (LN; n = 15) and validated key pathway genes by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and/or TCL1 trans-genic mice. Gene signatures representing several pathways critical for survival and activation of B cells were altered in CLL cells from different tissue compartments. Molecules associated with the B-cell receptor (BCR), B cell-activating factor/a proliferation-inducing ligand (BAFF/APRIL), nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B pathway and immune suppression signature were enriched in LN-CLL, suggesting LNs as the primary site for tumor growth. Immune suppression genes may help LN-CLL cells to modulate antigen-presenting and T-cell behavior to suppress antitumor activity. PB CLL cells overexpressed chemokine receptors, and their cognate ligands were enriched in LN and BM, suggesting that a chemokine gradient instructs B cells to migrate toward LN or BM. Of several chemokine ligands, the expression of CCL3 was associated with poor prognostic factors. The BM gene signature was enriched with antiapoptotic, cytoskeleton and adhesion molecules. Interestingly, PB cells from lymphadenopathy patients shared GEP with LN cells. In E$\mu$-TCL1 transgenic mice (the mouse model of the disease), a high percentage of leukemic cells from the lymphoid compartment express key BCR and NF-$\kappa$B molecules. Together, our findings demonstrate that the lymphoid microenvironment promotes survival, proliferation and progression of CLL cells via chronic activation of BCR, BAFF/APRIL and NF-$\kappa$B activation while suppressing the immune response.},

abstract = {Whether chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a latent or a proliferating disease has been intensively debated. Whilst the dogma that CLL results from accumulation of dormant lymphocytes is supported by the unresponsiveness of leukaemic cells to antigens and polyclonal activators, recent in vivo kinetic measurements indicate that B lymphocytes do divide at significant rates in CLL. However, an important and still unanswered question is whether CLL cells proliferate faster or slower compared with their normal counterparts. This report addressed directly this point and compared B-cell kinetics in CLL subjects and healthy controls, using a pulse-chase approach based on incorporation of deuterium from 6,6-2H2-glucose into DNA. We confirmed that B cells proliferated at significant levels in CLL but found that the proliferation rates were reduced compared with healthy subjects (mean 0.47 vs. 1.31%/d respectively, P = 0.007), equivalent to an extended doubling time of circulating B cells (147 d vs. 53 d). In conclusion, CLL B cells proliferate at reduced levels compared with healthy controls. CLL is thus characterized by an aberrant B-cell kinetics with a decrease in cell turnover, an observation that may impact on elaboration of efficient therapeutic strategies. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in adults, is still largely unknown. The full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains <20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Fabbri et al.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a neoplastic disease of unknown aetiology characterised by an absolute lymphocytosis in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The disease is diagnosed most commonly in the elderly with the median age at diagnosis being about 65 years. The purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs) fludarabine, cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) and pentostatin (2′-deoxycoformycin) are highly active in CLL, both in previously treated and in refractory or relapsed patients. These three agents share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action such as induction of apoptosis. However, they also exhibit significant differences, especially in their interactions with enzymes involved in adenosine and deoxyadenosine metabolism. Recent randomised studies suggest that fludarabine and cladribine have similar activity in CLL. However, clinical observations indicate the existence of cross-resistance between fludarabine and cladribine. Patients who received PNAs as their initial therapy and achieved long-lasting response can be successfully retreated with the same agent. PNAs administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents and/or monoclonal antibodies may produce higher response rates, including complete response (CR) or molecular CR, compared with PNAs alone or other treatment regimens. Management decisions are more difficult in elderly patients because of the apparent increase in toxicity of PNAs in this population. In elderly patients, we recommend chlorambucil as the first-line treatment, with PNAs in lower doses in refractory or relapsed patients. Myelosuppression and infections, including opportunistic varieties, are the most frequent adverse effects in patients with CLL treated with PNAs. Therefore, some investigators recommend routine antibacterial and antiviral prophylaxis during and after PNA treatment. This review presents current results and treatment strategies with the use of PNAs in CLL, especially in elderly patients. {\textcopyright} 2005 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Summary: Interactions in the tumour microenvironment can promote chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cell survival, proliferation and drug resistance. A detailed comparison of three co-culture systems designed to mimic the CLL lymph node and vascular microenvironments were performed; two were mouse fibroblast cell lines transfected with human CD40LG or CD31 and the third was a human microvascular endothelial cell line, HMEC-1. All three co-culture systems markedly enhanced CLL cell survival and induced a consistent change in CLL cell phenotype, characterized by increased expression of CD38, CD69, CD44 and ITGA4 (CD49d); this phenotype was absent following co-culture on untransfected mouse fibroblasts. In contrast to HMEC-1 cells, the CD40LG and CD31-expressing fibroblasts also induced ZAP70 expression and marked CLL cell proliferation as evidenced by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester labelling and increased Ki-67 expression. Taken together, our data show that co-culture on different stroma induced a remarkably similar activation phenotype in CLL cells but only the CD40LG and CD31-expressing fibroblasts increased ZAP70 expression and CLL cell proliferation, indicating that ZAP70 may play a critical role in this process. This comparative study reveals a number of striking similarities between the co-culture systems tested but also highlights important differences that should be considered when selecting which system to use for in-vitro investigations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Methods to deepen clinical responses to ibrutinib are needed to improve outcomes for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of combining a janus kinase (JAK)-inhibitor with ibrutinib because JAK-mediated cytokine-signals support CLL cells and may not be inhibited by ibrutinib. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was prescribed to 12 CLL patients with abnormal serum beta-2 microglobulin levels after 6 months or persistent lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly after 12 months on ibrutinib using a 3 + 3 phase 1 trial design (NCT02912754). Ibrutinib was continued at 420 mg daily and ruxolitinib was added at 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg BID for 3 weeks out of five for seven cycles. The break was mandated to avoid anemia and thrombocytopenia observed with ruxolitinib as a single agent in CLL. The combination was well-tolerated without dose-limiting toxicities. Cyclic changes in platelets, lymphocytes, and associated chemokines and thrombopoietic factors were observed and partial response criteria were met in 2 of 12 patients. The results suggest that JAK-signaling helps CLL cells persist in the presence of ibrutinib and ruxolitinib with ibrutinib is well-tolerated and may be a useful regiment to use in combination therapies for CLL.},

abstract = {The safety and efficacy of ibrutinib (420 mg) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) were evaluated in a phase 2 study; 51 patients had TP53 aberration (TP53 cohort) and 35 were enrolled because of age 65 years or older (elderly cohort). Both cohorts included patients with treatment-naive (TN) and relapsed/refractory (RR) CLL. With the median follow-up of 4.8 years, 49 (57.0%) of 86 patients remain on study. Treatment was discontinued for progressive disease in 20 (23.3%) patients and for adverse events in 5 (5.8%). Atrial fibrillation occurred in 18 (20.9%) patients for a rate of 6.4 per 100 patient-years. No serious bleeding occurred. The overall response rate at 6 months, the primary study endpoint, was 95.8% for the TP53 cohort (95% confidence interval, 85.7%-99.5%) and 93.9% for the elderly cohort (95% confidence interval, 79.8%-99.3%). Depth of response improved with time: at best response, 14 (29.2%) of 48 patients in the TP53 cohort and 9 (27.3%) of 33 in the elderly cohort achieved a complete response. Median minimal residual disease (MRD) in peripheral blood was 3.8 × 10-2 at 4 years, with MRD-negative (<10-4) remissions in 5 (10.2%) patients. In the TP53 cohort, the estimated 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 74.4% in TN-CLL compared with 19.4% in RR-CLL (P = .0002), and overall survival (OS) was 85.3% vs 53.7%, respectively (P = .023). In the elderly cohort, the estimated 5-year PFS and OS in RR-CLL were 64.8% and 71.6%, respectively, and no event occurred in TN-CLL. Long-term administration of ibrutinib was well tolerated and provided durable disease control for most patients. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01500733.},

abstract = {The identification of new genetic lesions in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) prompts a comprehensive and dynamic prognostic algorithm including gene mutations and chromosomal abnormalities and their changes during clonal evolution. By integrating mutational and cytogenetic analysis in 1274 CLL samples and using both a training-validation and a time-dependent design, 4 CLL subgroups were hierarchically classified: (1) high-risk, harboring TP53 and/or BIRC3 abnormalities (10-year survival: 29%); (2) intermediate-risk, harboring NOTCH1 and/or SF3B1 mutations and/or del11q22-q23 (10-year survival: 37%); (3) low-risk, harboring +12 or a normal genetics (10-year survival: 57%); and (4) very low-risk, harboring del13q14 only, whose 10-year survival (69.3%) did not significantly differ from a matched general population. This integrated mutational and cytogenetic model independently predicted survival, improved CLL prognostication accuracy compared with FISH karyotype (P <.0001), and was externally validated in an independent CLL cohort. Clonal evolution from lower to higher risk implicated the emergence of NOTCH1, SF3B1, and BIRC3 abnormalities in addition to TP53 and 11q22-q23 lesions. By taking into account clonal evolution through time-dependent analysis, the genetic model maintained its prognostic relevance at any time from diagnosis. These findings may have relevant implications for the design of clinical trials aimed at assessing the use of mutational profiling to inform therapeutic decisions. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), defective apoptosis causes the accumulation of mature CD5+ B cells in lymphoid organs, bone marrow (BM), and peripheral blood (PB). These cells are the progeny of a proliferating pool that feeds the accumulating compartment. The authors sought to determine which molecular mechanisms govern the proliferating pool, how they relate to apoptosis, and what the role is of the microenvironment. To begin to resolve these problems, the expression and modulation of the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) were investigated, with consideration given to the possibility that physiological stimuli, such as CD40 ligand (CD40L), available to B cells in the microenvironment, might modulate IAP expression. The in vitro data on mononuclear cells from PB or BM of 30 patients demonstrate that B-CLL cells on CD40 stimulation express Survivin and that Survivin is the only IAP whose expression is induced by CD40L. Through immunohistochemistry, in vivo Survivin expression in lymph node (LN) and BM biopsies was evaluated. In reactive LN, Survivin was detected only in highly proliferating germinal center cells. In LN from patients with B-CLL, Survivin was detected only in pseudofollicies. Pseudofollicle Survivin+ cells were actively proliferating and, in contrast to Survivin+ B cells found in normal GC, were Bcl-2+. In B-CLL BM biopsies, CD5+, Survivin+ cells were observed in clusters interspersed with T cells. These findings establish that Survivin controls the B-CLL proliferative pool interfacing apoptosis and that its expression may be modulated by microenvironmental stimuli. {\textcopyright} 2001 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Here we review the complex crosstalk of DNA damage response and immune response pathways that might be evolutionarily connected and argue that DNA damage response pathways can be explored therapeutically to induce disease tolerance through the activation of tissue damage control processes.

abstract = {Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) has a complex pattern of driver mutations and much of its clinical diversity remains unexplained. We devised a method for simultaneous subgroup discovery across multiple data types and applied it to genomic, transcriptomic, DNA methylation and ex-vivo drug response data from 217 Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) cases. We uncovered a biological axis of heterogeneity strongly associated with clinical behavior and orthogonal to the known biomarkers. We validated its presence and clinical relevance in four independent cohorts (n=547 patients). We find that this axis captures the proliferative drive (PD) of CLL cells, as it associates with lymphocyte doubling rate, global hypomethylation, accumulation of driver aberrations and response to pro-proliferative stimuli. CLL-PD was linked to the activation of mTOR-MYC-oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) through transcriptomic, proteomic and single cell resolution analysis. CLL-PD is a key determinant of disease outcome in CLL. Our multi-table integration approach may be applicable to other tumors whose inter-individual differences are currently unexplained.},

abstract = {The malignant, CD5+ B lymphocytes of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) die by apoptosis in vitro. This is in contrast to the prolonged life span of the leukemic cells in vivo and likely reflects the lack of essential growth factors in the tissue culture medium. We found that interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) inhibits programmed cell death and promotes survival of B-CLL cells in culture. This effect may also be important in vivo: increased serum levels of IFN-gamma, ranging from 60 to > 2,200 pg/ml, were found in 7 of 10 B-CLL samples tested, whereas the sera of 10 healthy individuals did not contain detectable levels of this cytokine (< 20 pg/ml). High levels of IFN-gamma message were detected in RNA from T cell-depleted B-CLL peripheral blood samples by Northern blot analysis. Synthesis of IFN-gamma by B-CLL lymphocytes was confirmed by in situ hybridization and flow cytometry. The majority of B-CLL cells (74-82%) expressed detectable levels of IFN-gamma mRNA, and CD19+ B-CLL cells were labeled with anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibodies. These results show that IFN-gamma inhibits programmed cell death in B-CLL cells and suggest that the malignant cells are able to synthesize this cytokine. By delaying apoptosis, IFN-gamma may extend the life span of the malignant cells and thereby contribute to their clonal accumulation.},

abstract = {The finding that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) consists of 2 clinical subsets, distinguished by the incidence of somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin (Ig) variable region (V) genes, has clearly linked prognosis to biology. Antigen encounter by the cell of origin is indicated in both subsets by selective but distinct expression of V genes, with evidence for continuing stimulation after transformation. The key to distinctive tumor behavior likely relates to the differential ability of the B-cell receptor (BCR) to respond. Both subsets may be undergoing low-level signaling in vivo, although analysis of blood cells limits knowledge of critical events in the tissue microenvironment. Analysis of signal competence in vitro reveals that unmutated CLL generally continues to respond, whereas mutated CLL is anergized. Differential responsiveness may reflect the increased ability of post-germinal center B cells to be triggered by antigen, leading to long-term anergy. This could minimize cell division in mutated CLL and account for prognostic differences. Unifying features of CLL include low responsiveness, expression of CD25, and production of immunosuppressive cytokines. These properties are reminiscent of regulatory T cells and suggest that the cell of origin of CLL might be a regulatory B cell. Continuing regulatory activity, mediated via autoantigen, could suppress Ig production and lead to disease-associated hypogammaglobulinemia. {\textcopyright} 2004 by The American Society of Hematology.},

@article{Lagneaux1998,
abstract = {ABSTRACT The leukemic B lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) patients have a long survival in vivo, although ex vivo they rapidly die by apoptosis. To further investigate the mechanism of this, we have studied the influence of bone marrow stromal cells from normal subjects on apoptosis of B-CLL cells and normal umbilical cord blood (UCB) B lymphocytes. After 48 hours of incubation in medium alone, leukemic and normal B cells showed, respectively, 22 ± 3% and 31 ± 5% of apoptosis. Cocultures with stromal cells reduced the percentage of leukemic cells undergoing apoptosis (8 ± 2%, P< .0005) and prevented the loss of bcl-2 protein expression. In contrast, stromal cells slightly increased normal B-cell apoptosis (37 ± 6%). Direct contact between leukemic cells and stromal cells was found to be essential for inhibition of leukemic cell apoptosis; indeed, separation of leukemic cells from stromal cells by microporous membrane increased spontaneous apoptosis, and comparable results were obtained with stromal cell conditioned medium. The difference in behavior observed between normal and leukemic B cells plated on stromal cells can be explained by the fact that only a few normal B cells adhere to stromal cells in comparison with B-CLL cells. B-CLL cell adhesion to stromal cells is mediated by $\beta$1 and $\beta$2 integrins acting simultaneously. Contact between B-CLL cells and bone marrow stromal cells seems to play a major role in the accumulation and survival of B-CLL cells in the bone marrow.},

abstract = {In lymphocytes, the phosphoinositide 3′-kinase (PI3K) isoform p110$\delta$ (PI3K$\delta$) transmits signals from surface receptors, including the B-cell receptor (BCR). CAL-101, a selective inhibitor of PI3K$\delta$, displays clinical activity in CLL, causing rapid lymph node shrinkage and a transient lymphocytosis. Inhibition of pro-survival pathways, the presumed mechanism of CAL-101, does not explain this characteristic pattern of activity. Therefore, we tested CAL-101 in assays that model CLL-microenvironment interactions in vitro. We found that CAL-101 inhibits CLL cell chemotaxis toward CXCL12 and CXCL13 and migration beneath stromal cells (pseudoemperipolesis). CAL-101 also down-regulates secretion of chemokines in stromal cocultures and after BCR triggering. CAL-101 reduces survival signals derived from the BCR or from nurse-like cells, and inhibits BCR- and chemokinereceptor - induced AKT and MAP kinase (ERK) activation. In stromal cocultures, CAL-101 sensitizes CLL cells toward bendamustine, fludarabine, and dexamethasone. These results are corroborated by clinical data showing marked reductions in circulating CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL13 levels, and a surge in lymphocytosis during CAL-101 treatment. Thus, CAL-101 displays a dual mechanism of action, directly decreasing cell survival while reducing interactions that retain CLL cells in protective tissue microenvironments. These data provide an explanation for the clinical activity of CAL-101, and a roadmap for future therapeutic development. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Due to its relatively slow clinical progression, B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is classically described as a disease of accumulation rather than proliferation. However, evidence for various forms of clonal evolution suggests that B-CLL clones may be more dynamic than previously assumed. We used a nonradioactive, stable isotopic labeling method to measure B-CLL cell kinetics in vivo. Nineteen patients drank an aliquot of deuterated water (2H2O) daily for 84 days, and 2H incorporation into the deoxyribose moiety of DNA of newly divided B-CLL cells was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, during and after the labeling period. Birth rates were calculated from the kinetic profiles. Death rates were defined as the difference between calculated birth and growth rates. These analyses demonstrated that the leukemic cells of each patient had definable and often substantial birth rates, varying from 0.1% to greater than 1.0% of the entire clone per day. Those patients with birth rates greater than 0.35% per day were much more likely to exhibit active or to develop progressive disease than those with lower birth rates Thus, B-CLL is not a static disease that results simply from accumulation of long-lived lymphocytes. Rather, it is a dynamic process composed also of cells that proliferate and die, often at appreciable levels. The extent to which this turnover occurs has not been previously appreciated. A correlation between birth rates and disease activity and progression appears to exist, which may help identify patients at risk for worsening disease in advance of clinical deterioration.},

The likelihood that these patients developed CLL clones with identical antibody V regions randomly is highly improbable and suggests selection by a common antigen. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from this stereotypic subset strongly bind cytoplasmic structures in HEp-2 cells. Therefore, HEp-2 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with recombinant stereotypic subset-specific CLL mAbs, revealing a major protein band at approximately 225 kDa that was identified by mass spectrometry as nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYHIIA). Reactivity of the stereotypic mAbs with MYHIIA was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence colocalization with anti- MYHIIA antibody. Treatments that alter MYHIIA amounts and cytoplasmic localization resulted in a corresponding change in binding to these mAbs. The appearance of MYHIIA on the surface of cells undergoing stress or apoptosis suggests that CLL mAb may generally bind molecules exposed as a consequence of these events. Binding of CLL mAb to MYHIIA could promote the development, survival, and expansion of these leuke-mic cells. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {DNA samples from patients with chronic lymphocytic (CLL), chronic myelocytic (CML), acute myelocytic (AML), and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), as well as samples from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and healthy volunteers, were analyzed for their genomic methylation status using Hpa II and Msp I digestions followed by a simple gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. A densitometric method was developed to measure more accurately the extent of methylation in genomic DNA samples and the results were confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of hydrolyzed DNA. Southern analysis with ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) gene probe was also employed, and the levels of ODC mRNA were determined with the aid of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The results indicated that a general genomic hypomethylation was present in almost all of the samples obtained from patients with B-cell CLL. This hypomethylation was most striking among the patients who were freshly diagnosed and among untreated chronic patients. CML appeared to be a heterogenous group, comprising patients with normal methylation status in addition to patients with slight hypomethylation. Patients with ALL, AML, or MM did not show any signs of DNA methylation changes in comparison to healthy volunteers. Although all analyzed samples from patients with B-CLL showed hypomethylation of ODC sequences, little correlation existed between the mRNA levels and the extent of hypomethylation of ODC gene.},

Perturbations in this pathway activity have been linked to several human genetic disorders and cancers. Recent genome-scale studies in Drosophila melanogaster have revealed an extraordinarily complex network of genes that can affect Notch activity. This highly interconnected network contrasts our traditional view of the Notch pathway as a simple linear sequence of events. Although we now have an unprecedented insight into the way in which such a fundamental signalling mechanism is controlled by the genome, we are faced with serious challenges in analysing the underlying molecular mechanisms of Notch signal control. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clinically heterogeneous disease characterized by the accumulation/expansion of a clonal population of neoplastic cells with the morphologic appearance of small mature B lymphocytes in blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid organs. A combination of genetic lesions is primarily responsible for the first step(s) of neoplastic transformation, along with microenvironmental signals, which concurrently operate by enhancing proliferation and/or inhibiting apoptosis. In this context, CD49d is known to play a pivotal role in mediating both cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions in CLL-involved tissues, eventually delivering pro-survival signals and protecting CLL cells from drug-induced damages. In the present review, we address, in detail, CD49d activities in the CLL microenvironment, CD49d functional and physical interactions with other microenvironmental receptors (including CD38 and B-cell receptor), and the relationship of CD49d expression with specific cytogenetic features in CLL. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Mature B-cells can recognize microbial antigens via B-cell-receptor (BCR) in a specific way and via Toll-like receptors (TLR) in a costimulatory manner. A wealth of information is gathering on the possible role of antigenic stimulation in the natural history of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL). However little is known regarding the repertoire and function of TLR in CLL cells. The TLR family includes 10 different transmembrane proteins devoted to recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns and to alarm immunocompetent cells to trigger an immune response. Here, we studied fresh leukaemic cells for the expression pattern of TLR1 to TLR10, NOD1, NOD2 and SIGIRR (also known as TIR8). CLL cells were found to express several pattern recognition receptors including TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, TLR10, NOD1 and NOD2. The specific TLR expressed by CLL cells were functional. Leukaemic cells, upon stimulation with TLR1/2/6 ligands, such as bacterial lipopeptides, activated the nuclear factor-$\kappa$B signalling pathway, expressed CD86 and CD25 activation molecules, and were protected from spontaneous apoptosis. These findings further support the hypothesis that CLL cells resemble antigen-activated B-cells and suggest a potential role of TLR in modulating CLL cell response in the context of specific antigen recognition. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The leukemic B lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemic (CLL) patients have a long survival in vivo, although ex vivo they rapidly die by apoptosis. To further investigate the mechanism of this, we have studied the influence of bone marrow stromal cells from normal subjects on apoptosis of B-CLL cells and normal umbilical cord blood (UCB) B lymphocytes. After 48 hours of incubation in medium alone, leukemic and normal B cells showed, respectively, 22 ± 3% and 31 ± 5% of apoptosis. Cocultures with stromal cells reduced the percentage of leukemic cells undergoing apoptosis (8 ± 2%, P< .0005) and prevented the loss of bcl-2 protein expression. In contrast, stromal cells slightly increased normal B-cell apoptosis (37 ± 6%). Direct contact between leukemic cells and stromal cells was found to be essential for inhibition of leukemic cell apoptosis; indeed, separation of leukemic cells from stromal cells by microporous membrane increased spontaneous apoptosis, and comparable results were obtained with stromal cell conditioned medium. The difference in behavior observed between normal and leukemic B cells plated on stromal cells can be explained by the fact that only a few normal B cells adhere to stromal cells in comparison with B-CLL cells. B-CLL cell adhesion to stromal cells is mediated by $\beta$1 and $\beta$2 integrins acting simultaneously. Contact between B-CLL cells and bone marrow stromal cells seems to play a major role in the accumulation and survival of B-CLL cells in the bone marrow.},

abstract = {Rituximab improves the outcome of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but does not completely eradicate residual B-cell populations in the microenvironment of the bone marrow and lymph nodes. Adhesion to stromal cells can protect B-cells from apoptosis induced by chemotherapy drugs [(cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR)]. A similar mechanism of resistance to rituximab has not, to our knowledge, been described. We tested the hypothesis that the microenvironment protects malignant B-cells from rituximab-induced apoptosis, and that blocking these interactions with natalizumab, an antibody targeting VLA-4 (integrin alfa-4-beta-1/CD49d), can overcome this protection. VLA-4 is an adhesion molecule constitutively expressed on malignant B-cells and is important for pro-survival signalling in the bone marrow and lymph node microenvironment. The human bone marrow stromal cell line HS-5 was shown to strongly protect B-cell lymphoma cells from rituximab cytotoxicity, suggesting the existence of a stromal cell adhesion-mediated antibody resistance (CAM-AR) mechanism analogous to CAM-DR. Natalizumab decreased B-lymphocyte adherence to fibronectin by 75-95% and partially overcame stromal protection against rituximab and cytotoxic drugs. These pre-clinical findings suggest that the addition of stromal adhesion-disruptive drugs to rituximab-containing therapy could improve treatment efficacy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has several unique features that distinguish it from other cancers. Most CLL tumour cells are inert and arrested in G0/G1 of the cell cycle and there is only a small proliferative compartment; however, the progressive accumulation of malignant cells will ultimately lead to symptomatic disease. Pathogenic mechanisms have been elucidated that involve multiple external (for example, microenvironmental stimuli and antigenic drive) and internal (genetic and epigenetic) events that are crucial in the transformation, progression and evolution of CLL.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The somatic genetic basis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a common and clinically heterogeneous leukemia occurring in adults, remains poorly understood. METHODS:We obtained DNA samples from leukemia cells in 91 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and performed massively parallel sequencing of 88 whole exomes and whole genomes, together with sequencing of matched germline DNA, to characterize the spectrum of somatic mutations in this disease. RESULTS:Nine genes that are mutated at significant frequencies were identified, including four with established roles in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (TP53 in 15% of patients, ATM in 9%, MYD88 in 10%, and NOTCH1 in 4%) and five with unestablished roles (SF3B1, ZMYM3, MAPK1, FBXW7, and DDX3X). SF3B1, which functions at the catalytic core of the spliceosome, was the second most frequently mutated gene (with mutations occurring in 15% of patients). SF3B1 mutations occurred primarily in tumors with deletions in chromosome 11q, which are associated with a poor prognosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We further discovered that tumor samples with mutations in SF3B1 had alterations in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing. CONCLUSIONS:Our study defines the landscape of somatic mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and highlights pre-mRNA splicing as a critical cellular process contributing to chronic lymphocytic leukemia.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), a short duration of response to therapy or adverse cytogenetic abnormalities are associated with a poor outcome. We evaluated the efficacy of ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, in patients at risk for a poor outcome. METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, phase 3 study, we randomly assigned 391 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL to receive daily ibrutinib or the anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab. The primary end point was the duration of progression-free survival, with the duration of overall survival and the overall response rate as secondary end points. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 9.4 months, ibrutinib significantly improved progressionfree survival; the median duration was not reached in the ibrutinib group (with a rate of progression-free survival of 88% at 6 months), as compared with a median of 8.1 months in the ofatumumab group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the ibrutinib group, 0.22; P<0.001). Ibrutinib also significantly improved overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.43; P = 0.005). At 12 months, the overall survival rate was 90% in the ibrutinib group and 81% in the ofatumumab group. The overall response rate was significantly higher in the ibrutinib group than in the ofatumumab group (42.6% vs. 4.1%, P<0.001). An additional 20% of ibrutinib-treated patients had a partial response with lymphocytosis. Similar effects were observed regardless of whether patients had a chromosome 17p13.1 deletion or resistance to purine analogues. The most frequent nonhematologic adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, pyrexia, and nausea in the ibrutinib group and fatigue, infusion-related reactions, and cough in the ofatumumab group. CONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib, as compared with ofatumumab, significantly improved progression-free survival, overall survival, and response rate among patients with previously treated CLL or SLL.

abstract = {Peripheral blood chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells are replicationally quiescent mature B-cells. In short-term cultures, supporting stromal cells provide a survival advantage to CLL cells by inducing transcription and translation without promoting proliferation. We hypothesized that the stromal microenvironment augments malignant B cells' metabolism to enable the cells to cope with their energy demands for transcription and translation. We used extracellular flux analysis to assess the two major energy-generating pathways, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and glycolysis, in primary CLL cells in the presence of three different stromal cell lines. OxPhos, measured as the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and maximum respiration capacity, was significantly higher in 28 patients' CLL cells cocultured with bone marrow–derived NK.Tert stromal cells than in CLL cells cultured alone (P =.004 and <.0001, respectively). Similar OCR induction was observed in CLL cells cocultured with M2-10B4 and HS-5 stromal lines. In contrast, heterogeneous changes in the extracellular acidification rate (a measure of glycolysis) were observed in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of CLL cells' metabolomics profile indicated stroma-mediated stimulation of nucleotide synthesis. Quantitation of ribonucleotide pools showed a significant two-fold increase in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells, indicating that the stroma may induce CLL cellular bioenergy and the RNA building blocks necessary for the transcriptional requirement of a prosurvival phenotype. The stroma did not impact the proliferation index (Ki-67 staining) of CLL cells. Collectively, these data suggest that short-term interaction (≤24 hours) with stroma increases OxPhos and bioenergy in replicationally quiescent CLL cells.},

abstract = {The recently discovered cytokine, interleukin-15 (IL-15), has been demonstrated to share several biologic properties with IL-2 in different cell systems, including T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell compartments. As for B lymphocytes, IL-15 has been shown to provide stimulatory activities in normal preactivated B cells that are mainly transduced through IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) complex components. Since leukemic B cells from patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLD) bear IL-2R and grow in response to IL-2, we investigated whether IL-15 triggers the proliferation of malignant B cells obtained from 12 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and five patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Enriched B cells recovered from five healthy subjects were also studied as controls. IL-15 stimulated the proliferation of freshly isolated leukemic B cells, but not resting normal B lymphocytes, the latter being able to grow in the presence of IL-15 only after in vitro preactivation with phorbol myristate acetate. The proliferation elicited by IL-2 on leukemic cells was comparable to that determined by IL-15. Following addition of graded concentrations of IL-15 to low/intermediate-dose IL-2, resting leukemic B cells showed a higher stimulatory rate than that observed using the two cytokines separately. In normal resting B lymphocytes, this cumulative effect was not observed. The role of different IL-2R subunits in IL-15-driven growth of malignant B cells was investigated both by their expression on leukemic cells and by the block of different IL-2R subunits (p55, p75, and p64) with specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). Using flow cytometry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses we demonstrated that both B-CLL and HCL leukemic B cells express the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ chains of the IL-2R system. The stimulatory activity achieved by IL-15 decreased significantly, blocking the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ chains of the IL-2R. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that IL-15 triggers the growth of leukemic B cells through IL-2R system subunits, pointing to the role of this novel cytokine in regulating the neoplastic proliferation in CLD. {\textcopyright} 1996 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggest that the diversity of the expressed variable (V) region repertoire of the immunoglobulin (Ig)H chain of B-CLL cells is restricted. Although limited examples of marked constraint in the primary structure of the H and L chain V regions exist, the possibility that this level of restriction is a general principle in this disease has not been accepted. This report describes five sets of patients, mostly with unmutated or minimally mutated IgV genes, with strikingly similar B cell antigen receptors (BCRs) arising from the use of common H and L chain V region gene segments that share CDR3 structural features such as length, amino acid composition, and unique amino acid residues at recombination junctions. Thus, a much more striking degree of structural restriction of the entire BCR and a much higher frequency of receptor sharing exists among patients than appreciated previously. The data imply that either a significant fraction of B-CLL cells was selected by a limited set of antigenic epitopes at some point in their development and/or that they derive from a distinct B cell subpopulation with limited Ig V region diversity. These shared, stereotyped Ig molecules may be valuable probes for antigen identification and important targets for cross-reactive idiotypic therapy.},

abstract = {The interaction between Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and monocyte-derived nurse-like cells (NLCs) is fundamentally important to CLL biology. However, studies of how CLL cells and NLCs interact have been hampered by the need for freshly obtained CLL blood samples, coupled with wide variation in the number of monocytes present in the blood of individual patients. Here, we report the development and validation of a cell-line model of NLCs which overcomes these difficulties. Co-culture of primary CLL cells with THP-1 cells induced to differentiate into macrophages by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) significantly reduced both spontaneous and fludarabine-induced cell death of leukemic cells. Furthermore, compared with their M1-polarized counterparts, M2-polarized macrophages derived from PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells conferred to CLL cells greater protection from spontaneous and fludarabine-induced apoptosis. Since NLCs resemble M2 tumor-associated macrophages, this cell-line model could be useful for investigating the mechanisms through which NLCs protect CLL cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The precise prognostic impact of TP53 mutation and its incorporation into treatment algorithms in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unclear. We set out to define the impact of TP53 mutations in CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS We assessed TP53 mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (exons 2 to 11) in a randomized prospective trial (n = 375) with a follow-up of 52.8 months (German CLL Study Group CLL4 trial; fludarabine [F] v F + cyclophosphamide [FC]). RESULTS We found TP53 mutations in 8.5% of patients (28 of 328 patients). None of the patients with TP53 mutation showed a complete response. In patients with TP53 mutation, compared with patients without TP53 mutation, median progression-free survival (PFS; 23.3 v 62.2 months, respectively) and overall survival (OS; 29.2 v 84.6 months, respectively) were significantly decreased (both P < .001). TP53 mutations in the absence of 17p deletions were found in 4.5% of patients. PFS and OS for patients with 17p deletion and patients with TP53 mutation in the absence of 17p deletion were similar. Multivariate analysis identified TP53 mutation as the strongest prognostic marker regarding PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.8; P < .001) and OS (HR = 7.2; P < .001). Other independent predictors of OS were IGHV mutation status (HR = 1.9), 11q deletion (HR = 1.9), 17p deletion (HR = 2.3), and FC treatment arm (HR = 0.6). CONCLUSION CLL with TP53 mutation carries a poor prognosis regardless of the presence of 17p deletion when treated with F-based chemotherapy. Thus, TP53 mutation analysis should be incorporated into the evaluation of patients with CLL before treatment initiation. Patients with TP53 mutation should be considered for alternative treatment approaches.},

abstract = {Although accumulating evidence indicates that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease with appreciable cell dynamics, it remains uncertain whether this also applies to patients with stable disease. In this study, (2)H(2)O was administered to a clinically homogeneous cohort of nine stable, untreated CLL patients. CLL dynamics in blood and bone marrow were determined and compared with normal B-cell dynamics in blood from five healthy individuals who underwent a similar (2)H(2)O labeling protocol. Average CLL turnover rates (0.08-0.35% of the clone per day) were approximately 2-fold lower than average B-cell turnover rates from healthy individuals (0.34-0.89%), whereas the rate at which labeled CLL cells in blood disappeared (0.00-0.39% of B cells per day) was approximately 10-fold lower compared with labeled B cells from healthy individuals (1.57-4.24% per day). Leukemic cell turnover variables inversely correlated with the level of somatic hypermutation of the CLL clone (IgVH mutations). Although CLL cells in bone marrow had a higher level of label enrichment than CLL cells in blood, no difference between proliferation rates and proapoptotic and antiapoptotic profiles of CLL cells from these compartments was observed. These data suggest that, in stable disease, there is a biological relationship between the degree of somatic hypermutation of the CLL clone and its dynamics in vivo. Furthermore, in contrast to lymph nodes, the bone marrow does not seem to be a major CLL proliferation site.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains associated with low complete response rates and high relapse rates. This is in part due to poor understanding of CLL biology and thus inadequate targeting of therapy. For years CLL has been proposed as bi-compartmental: the quiescent tumor in the periphery and the proliferating cells within specific microenvironments. Historically the bone marrow was considered the major tissue of the CLL microenvironment. However, many recent innovative studies have categorically shown that peripheral CLL cells are derived from the lymph nodes (LN). Proliferation here is largely driven by helper T cells via CD40CD40L engagement. Critically, in vitro studies have shown that such engagement additionally protects LN CLLs from apoptosis. Agents inducing apoptosis in non-CD40 engaged CLL cells are frequently ineffective against those continually engaged with CD40L. This emphasizes that, in order to improve responses and prevent relapse, novel therapies must be assessed against CD40L engaged CLL cells to show effective targeting against the LN. This review discusses the evidence supporting the superior involvement of the LN in CLL, how CD40L engaged CLL studies should be conducted, and the novel therapies studied in vitro and in vivo that have been proposed to be effective in this setting. {\textcopyright} 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) play an important role in trafficking of normal lymphocytes, monocytes, as well as hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells. SDF-1 constitutively produced by bone marrow stromal cells acts as a chemoattractant supporting the homing of stem cells and may also contribute to the tropism of malignant cells for the bone marrow. Low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), are characterized by the presence of bone marrow infiltration. Therefore, we analyzed expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in B-CLL, and investigated the functional effect of SDF-1 on the malignant cells. By flow cytometry, CXCR4 was consistently expressed on circulating CLL cells at a fluorescence intensity four-fold greater than that of normal B cells, and three-fold greater than that of CD19+/CD5+ cells from the normal bone marrow. CXCR4 was functionally active as demonstrated by a rapid flux of intracellular free calcium in response to SDF-1, which was significantly reduced by the partially blocking CXCR4 antibody 12G5. Moreover, transendothelial migration of B-CLL cells in vitro was stimulated by conditioned medium from bone marrow stromal cells due to its content of SDF-1, as suggested by reduced migration after addition of the CXCR4 antibody 12G5. In accordance with the CXCR4 overexpression, migration of CLL cells was more efficiently stimulated by recombinant SDF-1 compared to migration of normal B cells. We conclude that CXCR4 is overexpressed and functionally active in B-CLL, and may therefore contribute to the tropism of B-CLL cells for the bone marrow stroma.},

abstract = {B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of slow-dividing and long-lived monoclonal B cells arrested at the intermediate stage of their differentiation. We previously showed that interleukin 4 (IL-4) not only inhibits but also prevents the proliferation of B-CLL cells. We report here that IL-4 protects the B-CLL cells from death by apoptosis (programmed cell death [PCD]). IL-4 inhibits spontaneous and hydrocortisone (HC)-induced PCD of highly purified B cells from 12 unselected CLL patients, as shown by sustained cell viability and lack of DNA fragmentation. IL-1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and transforming growth factor beta have no protective effect. The in vitro rescue from apoptosis by IL-4 is reflected by an increased expression of Bcl-2 protein, a proto-oncogene directly involved in the prolongation of cell survival in vivo and in vitro. Hence, IL-4-treated B-CLL cells express significantly more Bcl-2 than unstimulated, HC-treated, or fresh B-CLL cells. Furthermore, subcutaneous injection of IL-4 into one CLL patient enhances Bcl-2 protein expression in the leukemic B cells. These data may suggest that IL-4 prevents apoptosis of B-CLL cells using a Bcl-2-dependent pathway. Given our recent observations that fresh T cells from B-CLL patients express IL-4 mRNA, we propose that IL-4 has an essential role in the pathogenesis of CLL disease, by preventing both the death and the proliferation of the malignant B cells.},

In contrast to many other mature B-cell lymphomas, only a few recurrently mutated genes involved in canonical or non-canonical NF-$\kappa$B activation have been identified in CLL (i.e. BIRC3, MYD88 and NFKBIE mutations) and often at a low frequency. On the other hand, CLL B cells seem ‘addicted' to the tumor microenvironment for their survival and proliferation, which is primarily mediated by interaction through a number of cell surface receptors, e.g. the B-cell receptor (BcR), Toll-like receptors and CD40, that in turn activate downstream NF-$\kappa$B. The importance of cell-extrinsic triggering for CLL pathophysiology was recently also highlighted by the clinical efficacy of novel drugs targeting microenvironmental interactions through the inhibition of BcR signaling. In other words, CLL can be considered a prototype disease for studying the intricate interplay between external triggers and intrinsic aberrations and their combined impact on disease evolution. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of mechanisms underlying NF-$\kappa$B deregulation in CLL, including micro-environmental, genetic and epigenetic events, and summarize data generated in murine models resembling human CLL. Finally, we will also discuss different strategies undertaken to intervene with the NF-$\kappa$B pathway and its upstream mediators.},

IKK activity was reduced by small molecules targeting BET proteins as well as by genetic knockdown of BRD2 and BRD4 expression, thereby inhibiting downstream NF-$\kappa$B-driven transcriptional programs and killing ABC DLBCL cells. Using a high-throughput platform to screen for drug-drug synergy, we observed that the BET inhibitor JQ1 combined favorably with multiple drugs targeting B-cell receptor signaling, one pathway that activates IKK in ABC DLBCL. The BTK kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, which is in clinical development for the treatment of ABC DLBCL, synergized strongly with BET inhibitors in killing ABC DLBCL cells in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the clinical development of BET protein inhibitors in ABC DLBCL, particularly in combination with other modulators of oncogenic IKK signaling.},

In addition, since its publication, new findings and ideas have been generated. This review summarizes the scientific rationale for the classification, emphasizing changes that have had an effect on practice guidelines. The authors address the criteria and significance of early or precursor lesions and the identification of certain lymphoid neoplasms largely associated with particular age groups, such as children and the elderly. The issue of borderline categories having overlapping features with large B-cell lymphomas, as well as several provisional entities, is reviewed. These new observations chart a course for future research in the field.},

abstract = {Models of transcription factor (TF) binding sites provide a basis for a wide spectrum of studies in regulatory genomics, from reconstruction of regulatory networks to functional annotation of transcripts and sequence variants. While TFs may recognize different sequence patterns in different conditions, it is pragmatic to have a single generic model for each particular TF as a baseline for practical applications. Here we present the expanded and enhanced version of HOCOMOCO (http://hocomoco.autosome.ru and http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/hocomoco10), the collection of models of DNA patterns, recognized by transcription factors. HOCOMOCO now provides position weight matrix (PWM) models for binding sites of 601 human TFs and, in addition, PWMs for 396 mouse TFs. Furthermore, we introduce the largest up to date collection of dinucleotide PWM models for 86 (52) human (mouse) TFs. The update is based on the analysis of massive ChIP-Seq and HT-SELEX datasets, with the validation of the resulting models on in vivo data. To facilitate a practical application, all HOCOMOCO models are linked to gene and protein databases (Entrez Gene, HGNC, UniProt) and accompanied by precomputed score thresholds. Finally, we provide command-line tools for PWM and diPWM threshold estimation and motif finding in nucleotide sequences.},

abstract = {All cancers are caused by somatic mutations; however, understanding of the biological processes generating these mutations is limited. The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathway is constitutively activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients, and hence plays a major role in disease development and evolution. In contrast to many other mature B-cell lymphomas, only a few recurrently mutated genes involved in canonical or non-canonical NF-$\kappa$B activation have been identified in CLL (i.e. BIRC3, MYD88 and NFKBIE mutations) and often at a low frequency. On the other hand, CLL B cells seem ‘addicted' to the tumor microenvironment for their survival and proliferation, which is primarily mediated by interaction through a number of cell surface receptors, e.g. the B-cell receptor (BcR), Toll-like receptors and CD40, that in turn activate downstream NF-$\kappa$B. The importance of cell-extrinsic triggering for CLL pathophysiology was recently also highlighted by the clinical efficacy of novel drugs targeting microenvironmental interactions through the inhibition of BcR signaling. In other words, CLL can be considered a prototype disease for studying the intricate interplay between external triggers and intrinsic aberrations and their combined impact on disease evolution. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of mechanisms underlying NF-$\kappa$B deregulation in CLL, including micro-environmental, genetic and epigenetic events, and summarize data generated in murine models resembling human CLL. Finally, we will also discuss different strategies undertaken to intervene with the NF-$\kappa$B pathway and its upstream mediators.},

To identify the molecular nature of this survival signal, we have developed a genetic approach in which ablation of the BCR is combined with the activation of specific, BCR dependent signaling cascades in mature B cells in vivo. Using this system, we provide evidence that the survival of BCR deficient mature B cells can be rescued by a single signaling pathway downstream of the BCR, namely PI3K signaling, with the FOXO1 transcription factor playing a central role.},

This led to the hypothesis that survival signals from the BCR are vital for mature B cells. Here, we test two critical assumptions of this model. First, we demonstrate loss of mature B cells upon induced mutation of a signaling module of the BCR, not precluding BCR surface expression. Second, we show that the cells are also lost upon BCR inactivation in the absence of an exogenous inducer like interferon, excluding that cell death depends on previous cellular activation by the latter. Kinetic data demonstrate that BCR-less mature B cells have a severely reduced lifespan, with a half-life of 3-6 days. Together these results establish that BCR signaling is required to keep resting mature B cells alive in vivo.},

Blood lymphocytes of all patients carried a single type of light chain, and 90%-100% of the cells were stained. The average number of antigenic sites per cell was 72,500 (range 40,000-97,500). These results differed from those previously found in typical CLL (mean value 9000) and approached the values of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes (90,000).

abstract = {Secreted proteins in the bone marrow microenvironment play critical roles in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Through an ex vivo functional screen of 94 cytokines, we identified that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) elicited profound expansion of myeloid progenitors in ∼67% of AML patients while suppressing the growth of normal progenitors. Levels of IL-1$\beta$ and IL-1 receptors were increased in AML patients, and silencing of the IL-1 receptor led to significant suppression of clonogenicity and in vivo disease progression. IL-1 promoted AML cell growth by enhancing p38MAPK phosphorylation and promoting secretion of various other growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. Treatment with p38MAPK inhibitors reversed these effects and recovered normal CD34+ cells from IL-1-mediated growth suppression. These results highlight the importance of ex vivo functional screening to identify common and actionable extrinsic pathways in genetically heterogeneous malignancies and provide impetus for clinical development of IL-1/IL1R1/p38MAPK pathway-targeted therapies in AML.},

abstract = {Purpose: The prognostic significance of ATM mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is unclear. We assessed their impact in the context of a prospective randomized trial. Patients and Methods: We analyzed the ATM gene in 224 patients treated on the Leukemia Research Fund Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 4 (LRF-CLL4) trial with chlorambucil or fludarabine with and without cyclophosphamide. ATM status was analyzed by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and was related to treatment response, survival, and the impact of TP53 alterations for the same patient cohort. Results: We identified 36 ATM mutations in 33 tumors, 16 with and 17 without 11q deletion. Mutations were associated with advanced disease stage and involvement of multiple lymphoid sites. Patients with both ATM mutation and 11q deletion showed significantly reduced progression-free survival (median, 7.4 months) compared with those with ATM wild type (28.6 months), 11q deletion alone (17.1 months), or ATM mutation alone (30.8 months), but survival was similar to that in patients with monoallelic (6.7 months) or biallelic (3.4 months) TP53 alterations. This effect was independent of treatment, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene (IGHV) status, age, sex, or disease stage. Overall survival for patients with biallelic ATM alterations was also significantly reduced compared with those with ATM wild type or ATM mutation alone (median, 42.2 v 85.5 v 77.6 months, respectively). Conclusion: The combination of 11q deletion and ATM mutation in CLL is associated with significantly shorter progression-free and overall survival following first-line treatment with alkylating agents and purine analogs. Assessment of ATM mutation status in patients with 11q deletion may influence the choice of subsequent therapy. {\textcopyright} 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Patients with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have clinically significant coexisting medical conditions are less able to undergo standard chemotherapy. Effective therapies with acceptable side-effect profiles are needed for this patient population. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of idelalisib, an oral inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, in combination with rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. We randomly assigned 220 patients with decreased renal function, previous therapy-induced myelosuppression, or major coexisting illnesses to receive rituximab and either idelalisib (at a dose of 150 mg) or placebo twice daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival. At the first prespecified interim analysis, the study was stopped early on the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board owing to overwhelming efficacy. RESULTS The median progression-free survival was 5.5 months in the placebo group and was not reached in the idelalisib group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the idelalisib group, 0.15; P<0.001). Patients receiving idelalisib versus those receiving placebo had improved rates of overall response (81% vs. 13%; odds ratio, 29.92; P<0.001) and overall survival at 12 months (92% vs. 80%; hazard ratio for death, 0.28; P=0.02). Serious adverse events occurred in 40% of the patients receiving idelalisib and rituximab and in 35% of those receiving placebo and rituximab. CONCLUSIONS The combination of idelalisib and rituximab, as compared with placebo and rituximab, significantly improved progression-free survival, response rate, and overall survival among patients with relapsed CLL who were less able to undergo chemotherapy.

In in vivo analyses of B-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary tumors, Syk inhibition induces apoptosis. These data prompted a phase 1/2 clinical trial of fostamatinib disodium, the first clinically available oral Syk inhibitor, in patients with recurrent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). Dose-limiting toxicity in the phase 1 portion was neutropenia, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia, and 200 mg twice daily was chosen for phase 2 testing. Sixty-eight patients with recurrent B-NHL were then enrolled in 3 cohorts: (1) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), (2) follicular lymphoma (FL), and (3) other NHL, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, and small lymphocytic leukemia/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). Common toxicities included diarrhea, fatigue, cytopenias, hypertension, and nausea. Objective response rates were 22% (5 of 23) for DLBCL, 10% (2 of 21) for FL, 55% (6 of 11) for SLL/CLL, and 11% (1/9) for MCL. Median progression-free survival was 4.2 months.

abstract = {ABSTRACT Cellular immunophenotypic studies were performed on a cohort of randomly selected IgM+ B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cases for which Ig VH and VL gene sequences were available. The cases were categorized based on V gene mutation status and CD38 expression and analyzed for treatment history and survival. The B-CLL cases could be divided into 2 groups. Those patients with unmutated V genes displayed higher percentages of CD38+ B-CLL cells (≥30%) than those with mutated V genes that had lower percentages of CD38+ cells (<30%). Patients in both the unmutated and the ≥30% CD38+ groups responded poorly to continuous multiregimen chemotherapy (including fludarabine) and had shorter survival. In contrast, the mutated and the <30% CD38+ groups required minimal or no chemotherapy and had prolonged survival. These observations were true also for those patients who stratified to the Rai intermediate risk category. In the mutated and the <30% CD38+ groups, males and females were virtually equally distributed, whereas in the unmutated and the ≥30% CD38+ groups, a marked male predominance was found. Thus, Ig V gene mutation status and the percentages of CD38+B-CLL cells appear to be accurate predictors of clinical outcome in B-CLL patients. These parameters, especially CD38 expression that can be analyzed conveniently in most clinical laboratories, should be valuable adjuncts to the present staging systems for predicting the clinical course in individual B-CLL cases. Future evaluations of new therapeutic strategies and drugs should take into account the different natural histories of patients categorized in these manners.},

This review focuses on the recent advances in understanding one of the earliest differentiation steps in HSC maturation, which involves the diversification of the lymphoid and myeloid cell lineages, the two major branches of hematopoietic cells. We discuss progress in the identification and characterization of progenitor populations downstream of HSCs, which has been a key to understanding the sequential biological events that take place along the course of differentiation into a certain hematopoietic cell type. We also discuss the importance of bone marrow microenvironment in lymphoid and myeloid lineage choice. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

Here, we present diffTF (https://git.embl.de/grp-zaugg/diffTF) to calculate differential TF activity (basic mode) and classify TFs into putative transcriptional activators or repressors (classification mode). In basic mode, it combines genome-wide chromatin accessibility/activity with putative TF binding sites that, in classification mode, are integrated with RNA-seq. We apply diffTF to compare (1) mutated and unmutated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and (2) two hematopoietic progenitor cell types. In both datasets, diffTF recovers most known biology and finds many previously unreported TFs. It classifies almost 40% of TFs based on their mode of action, which we validate experimentally. Overall, we demonstrate that diffTF recovers known biology, identifies less well-characterized TFs, and classifies TFs into transcriptional activators or repressors.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most frequent leukaemia in adults in Western countries, is a heterogeneous disease with variable clinical presentation and evolution. Two major molecular subtypes can be distinguished, characterized respectively by a high or low number of somatic hypermutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes. The molecular changes leading to the pathogenesis of the disease are still poorly understood. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of four cases of CLL and identified 46 somatic mutations that potentially affect gene function. Further analysis of these mutations in 363 patients with CLL identified four genes that are recurrently mutated: notch 1 (NOTCH1), exportin 1 (XPO1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and kelch-like 6 (KLHL6). Mutations in MYD88 and KLHL6 are predominant in cases of CLL with mutated immunoglobulin genes, whereas NOTCH1 and XPO1 mutations are mainly detected in patients with unmutated immunoglobulins. The patterns of somatic mutation, supported by functional and clinical analyses, strongly indicate that the recurrent NOTCH1, MYD88 and XPO1 mutations are oncogenic changes that contribute to the clinical evolution of the disease. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing with clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes. It highlights the usefulness of this approach for the identification of clinically relevant mutations in cancer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

Since its creation, MSigDB has grown beyond its roots in metabolic disease and cancer to include >10,000 gene sets. These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of "hallmark" gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a "refined" gene set, derived from multiple "founder" sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

@article{Collins1989,
abstract = {Summary When B‐cell lymphocytic leukaemia (B‐CLL) cells derived from peripheral blood were cultured in vitro, a substantial proportion of them spontaneously died by apoptosis. This type of cell death is morphologically and biochemically distinct from necrosis and has previously been found to occur under physiologic and certain pathologic conditions where cell deletion appears controlled and biologically meaningful. By 30 h of culture, approximately 20% of the unfractionated B‐CLL cells were affected. There was no significant difference in the incidence of apoptosis in T‐cell depleted and undepleted cultures or when either autologous or normal human serum was used. Furthermore, seeding densities of 2 × 106 and 5 × 105 cells/ml resulted in a similar incidence of apoptosis, indicating that cell density was unlikely to be a contributing factor in producing the death. The finding that B‐CLL cells spontaneously die in vitro has at least two important implications. Firstly, previous work relating to some of the functions of B‐CLL cells and their interactions with T cells may require re‐evaluation. Secondly, an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis in this disease may have therapeutic consequences. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

TP53, NOTCH1, and SF3B1 were mutated in 11.5%, 10.0%, and 18.4% of patients, respectively. NOTCH1(mut) and SF3B1(mut) virtually showed mutual exclusivity (0.6% concurrence), but TP53(mut) was frequently found in NOTCH1(mut) (16.1%) and in SF3B1(mut) (14.0%) patients. There were few significant associations with clinical and laboratory characteristics, but genetic markers had a strong influence on response and survival. In multivariable analyses, an independent prognostic impact was found for FCR, thymidine kinase (TK) ≥10 U/L, unmutated IGHV, 11q deletion, 17p deletion, TP53(mut), and SF3B1(mut) on progression-free survival; and for FCR, age ≥65 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥1, $\beta$2-microglobulin ≥3.5 mg/L, TK ≥10 U/L, unmutated IGHV, 17p deletion, and TP53(mut) on overall survival. Notably, predictive marker analysis identified an interaction of NOTCH1 mutational status and treatment in that rituximab failed to improve response and survival in patients with NOTCH1(mut). In conclusion, TP53 and SF3B1 mutations appear among the strongest prognostic markers in CLL patients receiving current-standard first-line therapy. NOTCH1(mut) was identified as a predictive marker for decreased benefit from the addition of rituximab to FC. This study is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00281918.},

abstract = {Clonal evolution and outgrowth of cellular variants with additional chromosomal abnormalities are major causes of disease progression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Because new DNA lesions occur during S phase, proliferating cells are at the core of this problem. In this study, we used in vivo deuterium (2H) labeling of CLL cells to better understand the phenotype of proliferating cells in 13 leukemic clones. In each case, there was heterogeneity in cellular proliferation, with a higher fraction of newly produced CD38+ cells compared with CD38− counterparts. On average, there were 2-fold higher percentages of newly born cells in the CD38+ fraction than in CD38− cells; when analyzed on an individual patient basis, CD38+2H-labeled cells ranged from 6.6% to 73%. Based on distinct kinetic patterns, interclonal heterogeneity was also observed. Specifically, 4 patients exhibited a delayed appearance of newly produced CD38+ cells in the blood, higher leukemic cell CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) levels, and increased risk for lymphoid organ infiltration and poor outcome. Our data refine the proliferative compartment in CLL based on CD38 expression and suggest a relationship between in vivo kinetics, expression of a protein involved in CLL cell retention and trafficking to solid tissues, and clinical outcome.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells encounter T-cells and proliferate in response to T-cell signals in the lymph node microenvironment. In this report we determined interleukin 21 (IL21) function in CLL and showed that IL21 and interleukin 4 (IL4) act co-operatively to promote leukaemic cell proliferation without apoptosis or differentiation We further show that IL21 increased side population (SP) cells, which are associated with resistance to chemotherapy and increased self-renewal capacity in CLL. IL21 and IL4 are the major cytokines produced by the recently described CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cell subset. Determination of Tfh cells in peripheral blood showed that patients had significantly increased numbers as compared to normal subjects although no association was found between Tfh numbers and IGHV gene mutational status or clinical stage. Our data suggests that the Tfh cytokines, IL4 and IL21, contribute to driving leukaemic cell proliferation in the lymph node microenvironment, and may contribute to the specific production of cells resistant to conventional chemotherapy. We suggest that increased circulating Tfh cells is a component of T-cell dysregulation in CLL. Our findings have implications for the therapeutic use of IL21. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {PURPOSE In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the VH mutation status and genomic aberrations (13q-, +12q, 11q-, 17p-) identify distinct prognostic subgroups. The aim was to elucidate biologic mechanisms through which these genetic markers may exert their pathogenic influence. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-four genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, B-cell activation, and B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) in 82 CLL cases constituting prototypic genetic CLL subgroups as defined by the VH mutation status and the genomic aberrations 13q-, +12, 11q-, and 17p-. RESULTS The VH mutation subgroups were characterized by a differential expression of the BCR associated genes ZAP70 and PI3K. Among the subgroups defined by genomic aberrations, there was a deregulation of candidate genes from the affected critical genomic regions such as CDK4 (up), ATM (down), and TP53 (down) in the groups +12, 11q-, and 17p-, respectively. Additionally, the genomic subgroups were characterized by a significant deregulation of cell cycle and apoptosis regulators: AKT (up) in 13q, E2F1 (up) in +12, MYC (up) and BCL-2 (down) in 17p-, and CCND3 (down) in 11q- as well as 17p-. The 17p- subgroup showed an additional down-regulation of BCR-associated genes such as SYK and PI3K. CONCLUSION The characteristic gene expression patterns observed implicate a differential regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis, and BCR signaling in the genetic subgroups illustrating distinct pathomechanisms and are evidence for a gene dosage effect being operative in CLL. These findings link the biologic diversity and clinical heterogeneity of CLL.},

Compared with 26 normal B cell samples, CLLs consistently displayed higher intrasample variability of DNA methylation patterns across the genome, which appears to arise from stochastically disordered methylation in malignant cells. Transcriptome analysis of bulk and single CLL cells revealed that methylation disorder was linked to low-level expression. Disordered methylation was further associated with adverse clinical outcome. We therefore propose that disordered methylation plays a similar role to that of genetic instability, enhancing the ability of cancer cells to search for superior evolutionary trajectories.},

abstract = {The transformation of normal cells into cancer cells and maintenance of the malignant state and phenotypes are associated with genetic and epigenetic deregulations, altered cellular signaling responses and aberrant interactions with the microenvironment. These alterations are constantly evolving as tumor cells face changing selective pressures induced by the cells themselves, the microenvironment and drug treatments. Tumors are also complex ecosystems where different, sometime heterogeneous, subclonal tumor populations and a variety of nontumor cells coexist in a constantly evolving manner. The interactions between molecules and between cells that arise as a result of these alterations and ecosystems are even more complex. The cancer research community is increasingly embracing this complexity and adopting a combination of systems biology methods and integrated analyses to understand and predictively model the activity of cancer cells. Systems biology approaches are helping to understand the mechanisms of tumor progression and design more effective cancer therapies. These approaches work in tandem with rapid technological advancements that enable data acquisition on a broader scale, with finer accuracy, higher dimensionality and higher throughput than ever. Using such data, computational and mathematical models help identify key deregulated functions and processes, establish predictive biomarkers and optimize therapeutic strategies. Moving forward, implementing patient-specific computational and mathematical models of cancer will significantly improve the specificity and efficacy of targeted therapy, and will accelerate the adoption of personalized and precision cancer medicine.},

abstract = {CD5-expressing B lymphocytes from patients with selected chronic lymphoproliferative disorders were used to determine whether monoclonal populations of CD5+ human B cells produce autoantibodies. CD5+ B cells from 19 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and one with diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (DWDL) were cultured, with and without mitogenic stimulation, to obtain Ig from these cells. 17 of the 20 samples produced Ig in vitro. mAb from nine of the 17 patients were reactive with either IgG, ssDNA, or dsDNA. In every instance, the autoantibodies displayed monotypic L chain usage that correlated precisely with the L chain expressed on the CD5+ leukemic B cell surface. These monoclonal autoantibodies varied in their degree of antigenic specificity; some were quite specific, reacting with only one antigen, whereas others were polyspecific, reacting with only one antigen, whereas others were polyspecific, reacting with two or all three autoantigens tested. Three features distinguish these autoantibodies from those observed in prior studies of CD5+ B cells. First, they are clearly the products of monoclonal populations of CD5+ cells; second, several react with dsDNA, a specificity not previously reported and often seen in association with significant autoimmune disorders; and third, two of the monoclonal autoantibodies secreted by the CD5+ clones were of the IgG class. Although not all of the Ig-producing, CD5-expressing clones elaborated mAbs reactive with the autoantigens tested, >50% did. It is possible that with a broader autoantigenic panel or with larger quantities of CLL/DWDL-derived Ig, even more autoantibody-producing clones might be identified. These studies may have important implications for the antigenic specificity of subsets of human B lymphocytes as well as for lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders in general.},

abstract = {Although modern treatment options for B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) produce high response rates, virtually all patients relapse, presumably due to the persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD). Novel approaches that maintain response and therefore delay growth of MRD may ultimately improve survival outcomes. In CLL, any type of continued therapy must be not only well tolerated but also convenient to ensure compliance. There has been some exploration of rituximab as maintenance therapy in CLL; however, given its limited clinical activity as a single agent, other options need to be studied. One such agent is the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide, which has demonstrated clinical activity both in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and in the frontline setting. Other attractive agents being explored in the maintenance setting include epigallocatechin gallate, curcumin, and the citrus pectin-derived galectin-3 inhibitor GCS-100. These naturally occurring compounds are well tolerated, and they inhibit survival signals in the microenvironment necessary for tumor development, making them well suited for evaluation as maintenance therapy for CLL.},

abstract = {B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease of expanding monoclonal B cells whose B cell receptor (BCR) mutational status defines 2 subgroups; patients with mutated BCRs have a more favorable prognosis than those with unmutated BCRs. CLL B cells express a restricted BCR repertoire including antibodies with quasi-identical complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), which suggests specific antigen recognition. The antigens recognized by CLL antibodies may include autoantigens since about half of CLL B cells produce autoreactive antibodies. However, the distribution of autoreactive antibodies between Ig heavy-chain variable-unmutated (IgV-unmutated) CLL (UM-CLL) and IgV-mutated CLL (M-CLL) is unknown. To determine the role of antibody reactivity and the impact of somatic hypermutation (SHM) on CLL antibody specificity, we cloned and expressed in vitro recombinant antibodies from M- and UM-CLL B cells and tested their reactivity by ELISA. We found that UM-CLL B cells expressed highly polyreactive antibodies whereas most M-CLL B cells did not. When mutated nonautoreactive CLL antibody sequences were reverted in vitro to their germline counterparts, they encoded polyreactive and autoreactive antibodies. We concluded that both UM-CLLs and M-CLLs originate from self-reactive B cell precursors and that SHM plays an important role in the development of the disease by altering original BCR autoreactivity.},

abstract = {Summary When B‐cell lymphocytic leukaemia (B‐CLL) cells derived from peripheral blood were cultured in vitro, a substantial proportion of them spontaneously died by apoptosis. This type of cell death is morphologically and biochemically distinct from necrosis and has previously been found to occur under physiologic and certain pathologic conditions where cell deletion appears controlled and biologically meaningful. By 30 h of culture, approximately 20% of the unfractionated B‐CLL cells were affected. There was no significant difference in the incidence of apoptosis in T‐cell depleted and undepleted cultures or when either autologous or normal human serum was used. Furthermore, seeding densities of 2 × 106 and 5 × 105 cells/ml resulted in a similar incidence of apoptosis, indicating that cell density was unlikely to be a contributing factor in producing the death. The finding that B‐CLL cells spontaneously die in vitro has at least two important implications. Firstly, previous work relating to some of the functions of B‐CLL cells and their interactions with T cells may require re‐evaluation. Secondly, an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis in this disease may have therapeutic consequences. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract = {Charting differences between tumors and normal tissue is a mainstay of cancer research. However, clonal tumor expansion from complex normal tissue architectures potentially obscures cancer-specific events, including divergent epigenetic patterns. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of normal B cell subsets, we observed broad epigenetic programming of selective transcription factor binding sites coincident with the degree of B cell maturation. By comparing normal B cells to malignant B cells from 268 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we showed that tumors derive largely from a continuum of maturation states reflected in normal developmental stages. Epigenetic maturation in CLL was associated with an indolent gene expression pattern and increasingly favorable clinical outcomes. We further uncovered that most previously reported tumor-specific methylation events are normally present in non-malignant B cells. Instead, we identified a potential pathogenic role for transcription factor dysregulation in CLL, where excess programming by EGR and NFAT with reduced EBF and AP-1 programming imbalances the normal B cell epigenetic program.},

abstract = {B cell-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents a common malignancy whose cell derivation and pathogenesis are unknown. Recent studies have shown that > 50% of CLLs display hypermutated immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) sequences and a more favorable prognosis, suggesting that they may represent a distinct subset of CLLs which have transited through germinal centers (GCs), the physiologic site of IgV hypermutation. To further investigate the phenotype of CLLs, their cellular derivation and their relationship to normal B cells, we have analyzed their gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide -based DNA chip microarrays representative of ∼12,000 genes. The results show that CLLs display a common and characteristic gene expression profile that is largely independent of their IgV genotype. Nevertheless, a restricted number of genes (<30) have been identified whose differential expression can distinguish IgV mutated versus unmutated cases and identify them in independent panels of cases. Comparison of CLL profiles with those of purified normal B cell subpopulations indicates that the common CLL profile is more related to memory B cells than to those derived from naive B cells, CD5+ B cells, and GC centroblasts and centrocytes. Finally, this analysis has identified a subset of genes specifically expressed by CLL cells of potential pathogenetic and clinical relevance.},

abstract = {Background Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells show prolonged survival in vivo, but rapidly die by spontaneous apoptosis in vitro, unless they are co-cultured with stromal cells or non-malignant leukocytes. The objective of this study was to characterize the survival-inducing cross-talk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with their microenvironment to identify novel therapeutic targets.Design and Methods We analyzed and compared microarray-based expression profiles of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells before and after three different survival-inducing culture conditions: (i) stromal cell co-culture, (ii) stromal cell conditioned medium and (iii) high cell density cultures of unsorted peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Cytokine antibody arrays were applied to study the composition of soluble factors present in these cultures.Results The different survival-supportive culture conditions induced distinct gene expression changes, the majority of which were common to all three conditions. Pathway analyses identified – in addition to known signaling networks in chronic lymphocytic leukemia – novel pathways, of which Toll-like receptor signaling, nuclear respiratory factor-2 (NRF2)-mediated oxidative stress response, and signaling via triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1) were the most relevant. A high proportion of up-regulated genes were inflammatory cytokines, of which chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) was shown to be induced in monocytes by the presence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro. In addition, increased serum levels of this chemokine were detected in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Conclusions Our data provide several lines of evidence that an inflammatory microenvironment is induced in survival-supportive cultures of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells which might be directly or indirectly involved in the prolonged survival of the malignant cells.},

abstract = {The tumour microenvironment and gene mutations collectively influence drug efficacy in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL), however an integrative understanding of their interplay is missing. We performed a combinatorial assay using 12 drugs individually co-applied with each of 17 microenvironmental stimuli in 192 primary CLL samples, generating a comprehensive map of drug-microenvironment interactions in CLL. We combined our data with whole-exome sequencing, DNA-methylation, RNA-sequencing and copy number variant data. We complemented these experiments by staining healthy and CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes for downstream mediators of key microenvironmental pathways. Our assay identified four distinct CLL subgroups that differed in their responses to the panel of stimuli and in patient outcomes, distinct from known prognostic groups. Additionally, we identified trisomy 12 as an amplifier of responses to the stimuli, mediated by the transcription factors Spi-B and PU.1. We quantified the impact of the stimuli on drug response, distinguished antagonistic and synergistic combinations and characterised their dependency on genetic alterations. The most frequent modulators of drug responses were stimuli activating Interleukin (IL) 4 and Toll-Like Receptor 7/8/9 signaling. Both pathways were more active in CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes than in healthy samples (p<0.001), and high IL4 activity in lymph nodes correlated with shorter survival (p=0.038). We provide a publically-available resource to investigate microenvironmental, genetic and drug interplay in CLL. Our results highlight the importance of tumour cell extrinsic influences on drug response and disease progression, and how these are further modulated by cell intrinsic molecular features.},

METHODS Eligible patients, aged $ 18 years with R/R CLL, were randomly assigned 1:1 centrally and stratified by del(17p) status, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score, and number of prior lines of therapy. Patients received acalabrutinib monotherapy or investigator's choice (idelalisib plus rituximab [I-R] or bendamustine plus rituximab [B-R]). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) in the intent-to-treat population. Key secondary end points included IRC-assessed overall response rate, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS From February 21, 2017, to January 17, 2018, a total of 398 patients were assessed for eligibility; 310 patients were randomly assigned to acalabrutinib monotherapy (n 5 155) or investigator's choice (n 5 155; I-R, n 5 119; B-R, n 5 36). Patients had received a median of two prior therapies (range, 1-10). After a median follow-up of 16.1 months (range, 0.03-22.4 months), median PFS was significantly longer with acalabrutinib monotherapy (PFS not reached) compared with investigator's choice (16.5 months [95% CI, 14.0 to 17.1 months]; hazard ratio, 0.31 [95% CI, 0.20 to 0.49]; P, .0001). Estimated 12-month PFS was 88% (95% CI, 81% to 92%) for acalabrutinib and 68% (95% CI, 59% to 75%) for investigator's choice. Serious adverse events occurred in 29% of patients (n 5 44 of 154) treated with acalabrutinib monotherapy, 56% (n 5 66 of 118) with I-R, and 26% (n 5 9 of 35) with B-R. Deaths occurred in 10% (n 5 15 of 154), 11% (n 5 13 of 118), and 14% (n 5 5 of 35) of patients receiving acalabrutinib monotherapy, I-R, and B-R, respectively. CONCLUSION Acalabrutinib significantly improved PFS compared with I-R or B-R and has an acceptable safety profile in patients with R/R CLL.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab, combined with chemotherapeutic agents, has been shown to prolong overall survival in physically fit patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but not in those with coexisting conditions. We investigated the benefit of the type 2, glycoengineered antibody obinutuzumab (also known as GA101) as compared with that of rituximab, each combined with chlorambucil, in patients with previously untreated CLL and coexisting conditions. METHODS: We randomly assigned 781 patients with previously untreated CLL and a score higher than 6 on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) (range, 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating worse health status) or an estimated creatinine clearance of 30 to 69 ml per minute to receive chlorambucil, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil, or rituximab plus chlorambucil. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. RESULTS: The patients had a median age of 73 years, creatinine clearance of 62 ml per minute, and CIRS score of 8 at baseline. Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil or rituximab-chlorambucil, as compared with chlorambucil monotherapy, increased response rates and prolonged progression-free survival (median progression-free survival, 26.7 months with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil vs. 11.1 months with chlorambucil alone; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13 to 0.24; P < 0.001; and 16.3 months with rituximab-chlorambucil vs. 11.1 months with chlorambucil alone; hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.57; P < 0.001). Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, as compared with chlorambucil alone, prolonged overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.23 to 0.74; P = 0.002). Treatment with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, as compared with rituximab-chlorambucil, resulted in prolongation of progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.49; P < 0.001) and higher rates of complete response (20.7% vs. 7.0%) and molecular response. Infusion-related reactions and neutropenia were more common with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil than with rituximab-chlorambucil, but the risk of infection was not increased. CONCLUSIONS: Combining an anti-CD20 antibody with chemotherapy improved outcomes in patients with CLL and coexisting conditions. In this patient population, obinutuzumab was superior to rituximab when each was combined with chlorambucil. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 Massachusetts Medical Society.},

abstract = {Marrow stromal cells (MSCs) provide important survival and drug resistance signals to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, but current models to analyze CLL–MSC interactions are heterogeneous. Therefore, we tested different human and murine MSC lines and primary human MSCs for their ability to protect CLL cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis. Our results show that both human and murine MSCs are equally effective in protecting CLL cells from fludarabine-induced apoptosis. This protective effect was sustained over a wide range of CLL–MSC ratios (5:1 to 100:1), and the levels of protection were reproducible in 4 different laboratories. Human and murine MSCs also protected CLL cells from dexamethasone- and cyclophosphamide-induced apoptosis. This protection required cell–cell contact and was virtually absent when CLL cells were separated from the MSCs by micropore filters. Furthermore, MSCs maintained Mcl-1 and protected CLL cells from spontaneous and fludarabine-induced Mcl-1 and PARP cleavage. Collectively, these studies define common denominators for CLL cocultures with MSCs. They also provide a reliable, validated tool for future investigations into the mechanism of MSC–CLL cross talk and for drug testing in a more relevant fashion than the commonly used suspension cultures.},

abstract = {Interleukin-21 (IL-21) is a member of the IL-2 cytokine family, which mediates proliferation or growth arrest and apoptosis of normal B cells, depending on their activation state. Here we demonstrate that surface IL-21 receptor (R) is expressed at variable levels by chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells freshly isolated from 33 different patients. IL-21R expression was up-regulated following cell stimulation via surface CD40. Therefore, IL-21 effects were more evident in CD40-activated CLL B cells. IL-21 induced an early signaling cascade in CLL B cells, which included JAK-1 and JAK-3 autophosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1, STAT-3, and STAT-5. IL-21 signaling failed to stimulate CLL B-cell proliferation, but induced their apoptosis. In addition, IL-21 counteracted the proliferative and antiapoptotic signals delivered by IL-15 to CLL B cells. IL-21-mediated apoptosis involved activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3, cleavage of Bid to its active form t-Bid, and cleavage of PARP and of p27Kip-1. Recent data indicate that CLL B cells require interaction with the microenvironment for their survival and expansion. The present findings thus provide a set of new mechanisms involved in the balance between cell-survival and apoptotic signals in CLL B cells.},

abstract = {Analysis of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) coding genome has recently disclosed that the NOTCH1 proto-oncogene is recurrently mutated at CLL presentation. Here, we assessed the prognostic role of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL. Two series of newly diagnosed CLL were used as training (n = 309) and validation (n = 230) cohorts. NOTCH1 mutations occurred in 11.0% and 11.3% CLL of the training and validation series, respectively. In the training series, NOTCH1 mutations led to a 3.77-fold increase in the hazard of death and to shorter overall survival (OS; P < .001). Multivariate analysis selected NOTCH1 mutations as an independent predictor of OS after controlling for confounding clinical and biologic variables. The independent prognostic value of NOTCH1 mutations was externally confirmed in the validation series. The poor prognosis conferred by NOTCH1 mutations was attributable, at least in part, to shorter treatment-free survival and higher risk of Richter transformation. Although NOTCH1 mutated patients were devoid of TP53 disruption in more than 90% cases in both training and validation series, the OS predicted by NOTCH1 mutations was similar to that of TP53 mutated/deleted CLL. NOTCH1 mutations are an independent predictor of CLL OS, tend to be mutually exclusive with TP53 abnormalities, and identify cases with a dismal prognosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The American Society of Hematology.},

In the B-cell lineage, this selection process is first applied to IgM+ immature B cells. By using increasingly sophisticated mouse models, investigators have identified the central tolerance mechanisms that negatively select autoreactive immature B cells and prevent inclusion of their antigen receptors into the peripheral B-cell pool. Additional studies have uncovered mechanisms that promote the differentiation of nonautoreactive immature B cells and their positive selection into the peripheral B-cell population.

abstract = {Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) B cells display characteristics consistent with a defect in programmed cell death (apoptosis) and exhibit prolonged survival in vivo. When recovered from peripheral blood or lymphoid tissues from the patient and cultured in vitro, these malignant cells rapidly undergo spontaneous apoptosis. This observation suggests that the selective survival advantage enjoyed by CLL B-cells is not entirely autonomous, raising the possibility of manipulating CLL B-cell survival by iatrogenic means. The extended survival of the neoplastic B-cells creates a permissive soil on which oncogene activation, genetic instability and accumulation of gene mutations favoring disease progression can occur. In addition, such survival-promoting microenvironments can rescue leukemia cells from cytotoxic therapy, giving way to disease relapse. Survival of CLL B-cells is influenced by interactions with non-leukemia cells in the microenvironment of lymph nodes, marrow and other tissues. CLL B-cells have developed many different ways to escape undergoing apoptosis. These include: (a) expression of survival receptor as well as their ligands, giving rise to autocrine survival pathways which are leukemia cell specific; (b) defects in plasma membrane receptor cell signaling, triggered by death receptors such as Fas- and TRAIL; and (c) constitutively active survival signaling pathways such as NF$\kappa$B and PI3K/Akt. Here we discuss some of the molecular mechanisms by which interaction with other cells and factors in the microenvironment provides survival advantages to CLL B-cells in specific in vivo niches, and we suggest some strategies for overcoming these anti-apoptotic mechanisms for improving treatment of CLL. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

Circulating trisomy 12 CLL cells have increased expression of the integrins CD11a and CD49d, as well as CD38, but the tissue expression of these and other molecules, and the functional and clinical sequelae of these changes have not been described. Here, we demonstrate that circulating trisomy 12 CLL cells also have increased expression of the integrins CD11b, CD18, CD29, and ITGB7, and the adhesion molecule CD323. Notably, there was reduced expression of CD11a, CD11b, and CD18 in trisomy 12 cases with NOTCH1 mutations compared with wild type. Trisomy 12 cells also exhibit upregulation of intracellular integrin signaling molecules CALDAG-GEFI, RAP1B, and Ras-related protein ligand, resulting in enhanced very late antigen-4 [VLA-4] directed adhesion and motility. CD38 expression in CLL has prognostic significance, but the increased CD38 expression in trisomy 12 CLL cells must be taken into account in this subgroup, and the threshold of CD38 positivity should be raised to 40% for this marker to retain its prognostic value. In conclusion, trisomy 12 CLL cells exhibit functional upregulation of integrin signaling, with $\beta$2-integrin expression being modulated by NOTCH1 mutation status. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Mutations in the ATM gene have been previously found in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (BCLLs) but their clinical significance is unknown. We analyzed 155 CLL tumors and found 12% with ATM mutations and 4% with TP53 mutations; 2 tumors contained mutations in both genes. Retrospective analysis on selected samples indicated that the ATM mutations were usually present at diagnosis. Compared with patients with wild-type ATM/TP53 genes, patients with ATM mutations had statistically significantly reduced overall and treatment-free survival. Although present in both IGVH mutation subgroups, ATM mutations were associated with unmutated IGVH genes and they provided independent prognostic information on multivariate analysis. Mutations in the ATM gene resulted in impaired in vitro DNA damage responses. Tumors with ATM mutations only partially correlated with tumors with loss of an ATM allele through an 11q deletion and, interestingly, those 11q-deleted tumors with a second wild-type ATM allele had a preserved DNA damage response. The majority of patients with ATM mutations were refractory to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic drugs and as such might benefit from therapies that bypass the ATM/p53 pathway. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Using molecular cytogenetics (FISH) and G-banding cytogenetic analysis, chromosome abnormalities were detected in 37 of 46 (80.4%) CLL patients. 13q14 deletion was the most common finding followed by trisomy 12 and 11q22.3 deletion. 17p13 deletion was also detected as were several less frequent chromosome abnormalities. The presence of these abnormalities significantly influenced the period of treatment-free survival as well as other clinical characteristics. In particular, CLL samples with trisomy 12 and 11q22.3 deletion were associated with shorter treatment-free survival. In order to identify the under-lying molecular differences among CLL subgroups with different chromosome abnormalities, gene expression profiling was performed on a custom DNA microarray consisting of 10,000 human gene-specific oligonucleotides. A gene dosage effect was observed where the expression of genes at the genetic loci of the sites of the somatic genomic abnormality was altered in a fashion according to the type of genomic change. This phenomenon was particularly evident in CLL samples with trisomy 12 and 17p13 deletion. Thus, this study demonstrates that genomic abnormalities influence gene expression in CLL by a dosage effect.},

abstract = {PURPOSE The emerging role of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) led us to ask whether TLR stimulation may protect CLL cells from drug-induced apoptosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We cultured in vitro malignant B cells freshly isolated from 44 patients with CLLs in the presence or the absence of different concentrations of fludarabine before or after 24-hour TLR stimulation with specific ligands and evaluated cell viability, apoptosis, and molecular pathways involved. RESULTS Heterogeneity was observed among samples. In leukemic cells from patients bearing adverse prognostic factors, TLR stimulation caused a significant increase of protection to fludarabine treatment, whereas this did not occur in the cells from patients with good prognosis. To identify novel molecular mechanisms accounting for the dichotomy of response between the two groups of patients, we conducted an apoptosis gene expression profile on leukemic cells either unstimulated or stimulated with TLR9 ligand. Strikingly, TLR9 stimulation specifically upregulated the expression of lymphotoxin-$\alpha$ in cells where an increased protection to fludarabine treatment was observed. Also, the expression of miR-155-3p was significantly increased after stimulation of distinct TLR in cells where fludarabine treatment was less effective. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that at least in a proportion of patients, in vitro sensitivity to fludarabine may be modulated by the stimulation of TLR, likely mimicking microenvironmental signals occurring in vivo.},

The clinical progression of CLL is heterogeneous and ranges from patients who require treatment soon after diagnosis to others who do not require therapy for many years, if at all. Several factors, including the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutational status, genomic changes, patient age and the presence of comorbidities, should be considered when defining the optimal management strategies, which include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy and/or drugs targeting B cell receptor signalling or inhibitors of apoptosis, such as BCL-2. Research on the biology of CLL has profoundly enhanced our ability to identify patients who are at higher risk for disease progression and our capacity to treat patients with drugs that selectively target distinctive phenotypic or physiological features of CLL.

abstract = {Growth and survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells are favored by interactions between CLL and nontumoral accessory cells. CLL cells express CXCR4 chemokine receptors that direct leukemia cell chemotaxis. Marrow stromal cells or nurselike cells constitutively secrete CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4, thereby attracting and rescuing CLL B cells from apoptosis in a contact-dependent fashion. Therefore, the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis represents a potential therapeutic target in CLL. We evaluated the most active CXCR4-specific antagonists (T140, TC14012, TN14003) for their capacity to inhibit CXCL12 responses in CLL cells. T140, or its analogs, inhibited actin polymerization, chemotaxis, and migration of CLL cells beneath stromal cells. CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was abolished by CXCR4 antagonists. TC14012 and TN14003 antagonized the antiapoptotic effect of synthetic CXCL12 and stromal cell-mediated protection of CLL cells from spontaneous apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that stromal cells protected CLL cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Treatment with CXCR4 antagonists resensitized CLL cells cultured with stromal cells to fludarabine-induced apoptosis. These findings demonstrate that CXCR4 blocking agents effectively antagonize CXCL12-induced migratory and signaling responses and stromal protection of CLL cells from spontaneous or fludarabine-induced apoptosis. As such, small molecular CXCR4 antagonists may have activity in the treatment of patients with this disease. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Critical components of the microenvironment are monocyte-derived nurselike cells (NLCs), mesenchymal stromal cells, T cells and NK cells, which communicate with CLL cells through a complex network of adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family members, and soluble factors. (Auto-) antigens and/or autonomous mechanisms activate the B-cell receptor (BCR) and its downstream signaling cascade in secondary lymphatic tissues, playing a central pathogenetic role in CLL. Novel small molecule inhibitors, including the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide-3-kinase delta (PI3K$\delta$) inhibitor idelalisib, target BCR signaling and have become the most successful new therapeutics in this disease. We here review the cellular and molecular characteristics of CLL cells, and discuss the cellular components and key pathways involved in the cross-talk with their microenvironment. We also highlight the relevant novel treatment strategies, focusing on immunomodulatory agents and BCR signaling inhibitors and how these treatments disrupt CLL-microenvironment interactions.

abstract = {We have extensively characterized the DNA methylomes of 139 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with mutated or unmutated IGHV and of several mature B-cell subpopulations through the use of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and high-density microarrays. The two molecular subtypes of CLL have differing DNA methylomes that seem to represent epigenetic imprints from distinct normal B-cell subpopulations. DNA hypomethylation in the gene body, targeting mostly enhancer sites, was the most frequent difference between naive and memory B cells and between the two molecular subtypes of CLL and normal B cells. Although DNA methylation and gene expression were poorly correlated, we identified gene-body CpG dinucleotides whose methylation was positively or negatively associated with expression. We have also recognized a DNA methylation signature that distinguishes new clinico-biological subtypes of CLL. We propose an epigenomic scenario in which differential methylation in the gene body may have functional and clinical implications in leukemogenesis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell malignancy, which is associated with profound alterations and defects in the immune system and a prevalent dependency on the microenvironmental niche. An abnormal T-cell compartment in the blood of CLL patients was already reported 40 years ago. Since then, our knowledge of T-cell characteristics in CLL has grown steadily, but the question of whether T-cells act as pro-tumoral bystander cells or possess anti-tumoral activity is still under debate. Increased numbers of CD4+ T-helper cell subsets are present in the blood of CLL patients, and T-helper cell cytokines have been shown to stimulate CLL cell survival and proliferation in vitro. In line with this, survival and growth of CLL cells in murine xenograft models have been shown to rely on activated CD4+ T-cells. This led to the hypothesis that T-cells are tumor-supportive in CLL. In recent years, evidence for an enrichment of antigen-experienced CD8+ T-cells in CLL has accumulated, and these cells have been shown to control leukemia in a CLL mouse model. Based on this, it was suggested that CD8+ T-cells recognize CLL-specific antigens and exert an anti-leukemia function. As described for other cancer entities, T-cells in CLL express multiple inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, and lose their functional capacity, leading to an exhaustion phenotype which has been shown to be more severe in T-cells from secondary lymphoid organs compared with peripheral blood. This exhausted phenotype has been suggested to be causative for the poor response of CLL patients to CAR T-cell therapies. In addition, T-cells have been shown to be affected by drugs that are used to treat CLL, which likely impacts therapy response. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about alterations of T-cells in CLL, including their distribution, function, and exhaustion state in blood and lymphoid organs, and touches also on the topic of how CLL drugs impact on the T-cell compartment and recent results of T-cell-based immunotherapy. We will discuss potential pathological roles of T-cell subsets in CLL and address the question of whether they foster progression or control of disease.},

abstract = {B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by an accumulation of mature, functionally incompetent B cells. Wnts are a large family of secreted glycoproteins involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and oncogenesis. The classical Wnt signaling cascade inhibits the activity of the enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$, augmenting $\beta$-catenin translocation to the nucleus, and the transcription of target genes. Little is known about the potential roles of Wnt signaling in CLL. In this study, we quantified the gene expression profiles of the Wnt family, and their cognate frizzled (Fzd) receptors in primary CLL cells, and determined the role of Wnt signaling in promoting CLL cell survival. Wnt3, Wnt5b, Wnt6, Wnt10a, Wnt14, and Wnt16, as well as the Wnt receptor Fzd3, were highly expressed in CLL, compared with normal B cells. Three lines of evidence suggested that the Wnt signaling pathway was active in CLL. First, the Wnt/$\beta$ -catenin-regulated transcription factor lymphoid-enhancing factor-1, and its downstream target cyclin D1, were overexpressed in CLL. Second, a pharmacological inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$, SB-216763, activated $\beta$-catenin-mediated transcription, and enhanced the survival of CLL lymphocytes. Third, Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling was diminished by an analog of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (R-etodolac), at concentrations that increased apoptosis of CLL cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Wnt signaling genes are over-expressed and are active in CLL. Uncontrolled Wnt signaling may contribute to the defect in apoptosis that characterizes this malignancy.},

@article{Schena1993,
abstract = {At least three categories of genes are envisaged to be involved in the natural history of B-CLL. First, the genes that are responsible for the transforming event(s) in the (presently unknown) target cell; second, the gene(s) that help the progressive accumulation of malignant cells and finally the gene(s) that cause the progression toward a more aggressive lymphoma. The possibility that the clonal expansion of B-CLL is due to a prolonged life-span of monoclonal B cells rather than to an acceleration of their proliferative activity may now be reinterpreted by taking into account some recent findings on the expression of Bcl-2 gene in B-CLL cells. The Bcl-2 gene product regulates programmed cell death and a number of experiments suggest that Bcl-2 is involved in the selection and maintenance of long-lived memory B cells rescuing them from apoptotic death and leading to their accumulation in the GO phase of the cell cycle. Variant chromosomal translocations have been detected in a small fraction (5-10% of B-CLL, involving Bcl-2 and the Ig light chain gene. Despite the low percentage of Bcl-2 rearrangements the expression of mRNA and protein is appreciable in most samples of fresh B-CLL cells in an amount comparable to that observed in Karpas 422 cells, which contain a t(14;lS). Southern blot analysis of 16 B-CLL cases with high expression of Bcl-2 failed to reveal both gene amplification and rearrangement, thereby suggesting that the level of Bcl-2 expression in B-CLL does not reflect a rearrangement of Bcl-2 gene, which appears to be a rare event in CLL cells. In addition, the half life of Bcl-2 mRNA is not prolonged in CLL cells. The expression of Bcl-2 mRNA can be modulated in B-CLL cells by using B cell activators and cytokines. In the transition from a resting to a cycling phase, Bcl-2 expression is downregulated indicating that proliferation and Bcl-2 expression are inversely related in malignant B-CLL cells from peripheral blood as observed for normal B lymphocytes derived from secondary follicles. By culturing B-CLL cells in the presence of an antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the translation-initiation site of Bcl-2 gene, DNA fragmentation, characteristic of apoptosis, can be seen in a proportion of cases. These data lead to the plausible hypothesis that the high Bcl-2 expression in B-CLL cells might confer on them a survival advantage favouring their relentless accumulation, perhaps by inhibition of apoptosis. {\textcopyright} 1993 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

Toward the identification of the putative CLL tumor suppressor, we have constructed a high-resolution physical map of YAC, PAC, and cosmid contigs covering 600 kb of the 13q14 genomic region. In addition to densely positioned genetic markers and STSs, this map was further annotated by localization of 32 transcribed sequences (ESTs) using a combination of exon trapping, direct cDNA selection, sample sequencing of cosmids and PACs, and homology searches. On the basis of these mapping data, allelic loss analyses at 13q14 using CLL tumor samples allowed narrowing of the genomic segment encompassing the putative CLL gene to <300 kb. Twenty-three ESTs located within this minimally deleted region are candidate exons for the CLL-associated tumor suppressor gene.},

abstract = {Although trisomy 12 (+12) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) comprises about 20% of cases, relatively little is known about its pathophysiology. These cases often demonstrate atypical morphological and immunophenotypic features, high proliferative rates, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes, and a high frequency of NOTCH1 mutation. Patients with +12 CLL have an intermediate prognosis, and show higher incidences of thrombocytopenia, Richter transformation, and other secondary cancers. Despite these important differences, relatively few transcriptional profiling studies have focused on identifying dysregulated pathways that characterize +12 CLL, and most have used a hierarchical cytogenetic classification in which cases with more than one recurrent abnormality are categorized according to the abnormality with the poorest prognosis. In this study, we sought to identify protein-coding genes whose expression contributes to the unique pathophysiology of +12 CLL. To exclude the likely confounding effects of multiple cytogenetic abnormalities on gene expression, our +12 patient cohort had +12 as the sole abnormality. We profiled samples obtained from 147 treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients. We compared cases with +12 as the only cytogenetic abnormality to cases with only del(13q), del(11q), or diploid cytogenetics using independent discovery (n=97) and validation (n=50) sets. We demonstrate that CLL cases with +12 as the sole abnormality express a unique set of activated pathways compared to other cytogenetic subtypes. Among these pathways, we identify the NFAT signaling pathway and the immune checkpoint molecule, NT5E (CD73), which may represent new therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Kinases are dysregulated in most cancers, but the frequency of specific kinase mutations is low, indicating a complex etiology in kinase dysregulation. Here, we report a strategy to rapidly identify functionally important kinase targets, irrespective of the etiology of kinase pathway dysregulation, ultimately enabling a correlation of patient genetic profiles to clinically effective kinase inhibitors. Our methodology assessed the sensitivity of primary leukemia patient samples to a panel of 66 small-molecule kinase inhibitors over 3 days. Screening of 151 leukemia patient samples revealed a wide diversity of drug sensitivities, with 70% of the clinical specimens exhibiting hypersensitivity to one or more drugs. From this data set, we developed an algorithm to predict kinase pathway dependence based on analysis of inhibitor sensitivity patterns. Applying this algorithm correctly identified pathway dependence in proof-of-principle specimens with known oncogenes, including a rare FLT3 mutation outside regions covered by standard molecular diagnostic tests. Interrogation of all 151 patient specimens with this algorithm identified a diversity of kinase targets and signaling pathways that could aid prioritization of deep sequencing data sets, permitting a cumulative analysis to understand kinase pathway dependence within leukemia subsets. In a proof-of-principle case, we showed that in vitro drug sensitivity could predict both a clinical response and the development of drug resistance. Taken together, our results suggested that drug target scores derived from a comprehensive kinase inhibitor panel could predict pathway dependence in cancer cells while simultaneously identifying potential therapeutic options. {\textcopyright}2012 AACR.},

abstract = {Interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) is central to the transcriptional network of activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL), an aggressive lymphoma subgroup defined by gene expression profiling. Since cofactor association modifies transcriptional regulatory input by IRF4, we assessed genome occupancy by IRF4 and endogenous cofactors in ABC-DLBCL cell lines. IRF4 partners with SPIB, PU.1 and BATF genome-wide, but SPIB provides the dominant IRF4 partner in this context. Upon SPIB knockdown IRF4 occupancy is depleted and neither PU.1 nor BATF acutely compensates. Integration with ENCODE data from lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878, demonstrates that IRF4 adopts either SPIB- or BATF-centric genome-wide distributions in related states of post-germinal centre B-cell transformation. In primary DLBCL high-SPIB and low-BATF or the reciprocal low-SPIB and high-BATF mRNA expression links to differential gene expression profiles across nine data sets, identifying distinct associations with SPIB occupancy, signatures of B-cell differentiation stage and potential pathogenetic mechanisms. In a population-based patient cohort, SPIBhigh/BATFlow-ABC-DLBCL is enriched for mutation of MYD88, and SPIBhigh/BATFlow-ABC-DLBCL with MYD88-L265P mutation identifies a small subgroup of patients among this otherwise aggressive disease subgroup with distinct favourable outcome. We conclude that differential expression of IRF4 cofactors SPIB and BATF identifies biologically and clinically significant heterogeneity among ABC-DLBCL. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cells are hyporesponsive to many proliferative signals that induce activation of normal B-lymphocytes. However, a heterogeneous response has recently been observed with immunostimulatory CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN). We now show that CpG ODN induce proliferation mainly in CLL B-cells from patients with progressive disease and unmutated immunoglobulin VH genes, whereas G1/S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are induced in leukemic B-cells from stable/VH mutated CLL. Examination of early signaling events demonstrated that all CLL B-cells respond to CpG ODN stimulation by degradation of the NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor I$\kappa$B and activation of the Akt, ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK kinases, but the magnitude and duration of the signaling response was greater in the proliferating cases. Pharmacological inhibition of these pathways showed that simultaneous activation of Akt, ERK and JNK is required for cell cycle progression and proliferation. Conversely, introduction of constitutively active Akt in nonproliferating CLL B-cells resulted in induction of cyclin A following CpG ODN stimulation, indicating that increased Akt activation is sufficient to overcome the hyporesponsiveness of these cells to proliferative signals. Thus, the magnitude of Akt signaling may determine the distinct responses observed in leukemic B-cells belonging to the different prognostic subgroups.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells have defects in apoptosis pathways and therefore accumulate in vivo. However, when removed from the patient and cultured in vitro, these malignant cells rapidly undergo apoptosis. Recent studies suggest that leukemia cell survival is influenced by interactions with nonleukemia cells in the microenvironment of lymph nodes, marrow, and other tissues. To model such cell-cell interactions in vitro, we cultured freshly isolated CLL B cells with a follicular dendritic cell line, HK. CLL B cells cocultured with HK cells were protected from apoptosis, either spontaneous or induced by treatment with anticancer drugs. Protection against spontaneous apoptosis could also be induced by coculturing the CLL B cells with normal dendritic cells (DCs) or with a CD40-ligand (CD154)-expressing fibroblast cell line. Examination of the expression of several apoptosis-regulatory proteins revealed that coculture with HK cells or DCs induced up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 in CLL B cells, whereas CD40 ligation increased expression of Bcl-XL. Cell-cell contact was required for HK-induced protection, and introducing neutralizing antibodies against various adhesion molecules showed that CD44 was involved in HK-mediated survival, whereas CD40, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were not. Anti-CD44 antibodies also blocked Mcl-1 induction by HK cells. Mcl-1 antisense oligonucleotides reduced leukemia cell expression of Mcl-1, and significantly suppressed HK-induced protection against apoptosis, whereas control oligonucleotides had no effect. Thus, HK cells protect CLL B cells against apoptosis, at least in part through a CD44-dependent mechanism involving up-regulation of Mcl-1, and this mechanism is distinct from that achieved by CD40 ligation. Consequently, the particular anti-apoptotic proteins important for CLL survival may vary depending on the microenvironment. {\textcopyright} 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Clonal evolution is a key feature of cancer progression and relapse. We studied intratumoral heterogeneity in 149 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases by integrating whole-exome sequence and copy number to measure the fraction of cancer cells harboring each somatic mutation. We identified driver mutations as predominantly clonal (e.g., MYD88, trisomy 12, and del(13q)) or subclonal (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53), corresponding to earlier and later events in CLL evolution. We sampled leukemia cells from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution, predominantly involving subclones with driver mutations (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid disease progression. Our study thus uncovers patterns of clonal evolution in CLL, providing insights into its stepwise transformation, and links the presence of subclones with adverse clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most frequent leukemia in adults. We have analyzed exome sequencing data from 127 individuals with CLL and Sanger sequencing data from 214 additional affected individuals, identifying recurrent somatic mutations in POT1 (encoding protection of telomeres 1) in 3.5% of the cases, with the frequency reaching 9% when only individuals without IGHV@ mutations were considered. POT1 encodes a component of the shelterin complex and is the first member of this telomeric structure found to be mutated in human cancer. Somatic mutation of POT1 primarily occurs in gene regions encoding the two oligonucleotide-/oligosaccharide-binding (OB) folds and affects key residues required to bind telomeric DNA. POT1-mutated CLL cells have numerous telomeric and chromosomal abnormalities that suggest that POT1 mutations favor the acquisition of the malignant features of CLL cells. The identification of POT1 as a new frequently mutated gene in CLL may facilitate novel approaches for the clinical management of this disease. {\textcopyright} 2013 Nature America, Inc.

abstract = {Many functional consequences of mutations on tumor phenotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are unknown. This may be in part due to a scarcity of information on the proteome of CLL. We profiled the proteome of 117 CLL patient samples with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and integrated the results with genomic, transcriptomic, ex vivo drug response and clinical outcome data. We found trisomy 12, IGHV mutational status, mutated SF3B1, trisomy 19, del(17)(p13), del(11)(q22.3), mutated DDX3X, and MED12 to influence protein expression (FDR < 5%). Trisomy 12 and IGHV status were the major determinants of protein expression variation in CLL as shown by principal component analysis (1055 and 542 differentially expressed proteins, FDR=5%). Gene set enrichment analyses of CLL with trisomy 12 implicated BCR/PI3K/AKT signaling as a tumor driver. These findings were supported by analyses of protein abundance buffering and protein complex formation, which identified limited protein abundance buffering and an upregulated protein complex involved in BCR, AKT, MAPK and PI3K signaling in trisomy 12 CLL. A survey of proteins associated with trisomy 12/IGHV-independent drug response linked STAT2 protein expression with response to kinase inhibitors including BTK and MEK inhibitors. STAT2 was upregulated in U-CLL, trisomy 12 CLL and required for chemokine/cytokine signaling (interferon response). This study highlights the importance of protein abundance data as a non-redundant layer of information in tumor biology, and provides a protein expression reference map for CLL.},

abstract = {Purpose: Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 cell surface antigen, has clinical activity in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and other B-lymphocyte disorders when administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Promising results have previously been reported in nonrandomized studies in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This trial was designed to compare chemoimmunotherapy with chemotherapy alone in patients with previously treated CLL. Patients and Methods: This international, multicenter, randomized trial compared six cycles of rituximab plus fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) with six cycles of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide alone (FC) in patients with previously treated CLL. A total of 552 patients with Binet stage A (10%), B (59%), or C (31%) disease entered the study and were randomly assigned to receive R-FC (n = 276) or FC (n = 276). Results: After a median follow-up time of 25 months, rituximab significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with previously treated CLL (hazard ratio = 0.65; P < .001; median, 30.6 months for R-FC v 20.6 months for FC). Event-free survival, response rate, complete response rate, duration of response, and time to new CLL treatment or death were also significantly improved. Although the rates of adverse events, grade 3 or 4 events, and serious adverse events were slightly higher in the R-FC arm, R-FC was generally well tolerated, with no new safety findings and no detrimental effect on quality of life. Conclusion: R-FC significantly improved the outcome of patients with previously treated CLL. {\textcopyright} 2010 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {The systematic translation of cancer genomic data into knowledge of tumour biology and therapeutic possibilities remains challenging. Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of personalized' therapeutic regimens. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

@article{Jayappa2017,
abstract = {De novo resistance and rapid recurrence often characterize responses of B-cell malignancies to ibrutinib (IBR), indicating a need to develop drug combinations that block compensatory survival signaling and give deeper, more durable responses. To identify such combinations, we previously performed a combinatorial drug screen and identified the Bcl-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) as a promising partner for combination with IBR in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). We have opened a multi-institutional clinical trial to test this combination. However, analysis of primary samples from patients with MCL as well as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) revealed unexpected heterogeneous de novo resistance even to the IBR1VEN combination. In the current study, we demonstrate that resistance to the combination can be generated by microenvironmental agonists: interleukin-10 (IL-10), CD40L and, most potently, cytosine guanine dinucleotide–oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODNs), which is a surrogate for unmethylated DNA and a specific agonist for Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) signaling. Incubation with these agonists caused robust activation of NF-kB signaling, especially alternative NF-kB, which led to enhanced expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and survivin, thus decreasing dependence on Bcl-2. Inhibitors of NF-kB signaling blocked overexpression of these antiapoptotic proteins and overcame resistance. Inhibitors of Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, or survivin also overcame this resistance, and showed synergistic benefit with the IBR1VEN combination. We conclude that microenvironmental factors, particularly the TLR9 agonist, can generate de novo resistance to the IBR1VEN combination in CLL and MCL cells. This signaling pathway presents targets for overcoming drug resistance induced by extrinsic microenvironmental factors in diverse B-cell malignancies.},

BCL2 repression by these microRNAs induces apoptopsis in a leukemic cell line model.

Therefore, we tested different human and murine MSC lines and primary human MSCs for their ability to protect CLL cells from spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis. Our results show that both human and murine MSCs are equally effective in protecting CLL cells from fludarabine-induced apoptosis. This protective effect was sustained over a wide range of CLL–MSC ratios (5:1 to 100:1), and the levels of protection were reproducible in 4 different laboratories. Human and murine MSCs also protected CLL cells from dexamethasone- and cyclophosphamide-induced apoptosis. This protection required cell–cell contact and was virtually absent when CLL cells were separated from the MSCs by micropore filters. Furthermore, MSCs maintained Mcl-1 and protected CLL cells from spontaneous and fludarabine-induced Mcl-1 and PARP cleavage. Collectively, these studies define common denominators for CLL cocultures with MSCs. They also provide a reliable, validated tool for future investigations into the mechanism of MSC–CLL cross talk and for drug testing in a more relevant fashion than the commonly used suspension cultures.},

abstract = {Although B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells express the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor CD25, little is known about the effect of IL-2 on apoptosis in B-CLL cells. We have shown previously that stimulation of B-CLL cells with a CpG-oligonucleotide induces IL-2 high affinity receptors. In our current work, we analyzed the effect of IL-2 on apoptosis in resting B-CLL cells and in our model of activated B-CLL cells (CD25 high cells). IL-2 had modest antiapoptotic activity in resting B-CLL cells. In contrast, IL-2 was much more potent to prevent apoptosis in activated cells. Prevention of cell death was also associated with the maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential. While only limited regulation of apoptosis controlling proteins was observed in resting B-CLL cells, IL-2 had strong effects on MCL-1, Bcl-xl, and survivin expression and inhibited Bax cleavage in CD25 high cells. Interestingly, expression of Bcl-2 was reduced. Addition of IL-2 to activated B-CLL cells caused rapid phosphorylation of Akt, while IL-2 failed to significantly phosphorylate Akt in resting B-CLL cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Akt by LY294002 restored sensitivity of activated B-CLL cells to fludarabine. IL-2 might be an important survival factor in activated B-CLL cells and might contribute to disease progression by upregulation of several critical antiapoptotic proteins.},

Peripheral blood samples of 298 patients with CLL and 166 patients with non- CLL were analyzed by flow cytometry. Using the five standard markers, the accuracy of the scoring system was 91.8%, using a cutoff of 4 points or higher, to distinguish CLL from non-CLL. This was increased to 96.6% if SN8 was added and a cutoff of 4 points or higher was also used. A similar accuracy, 96.8%, was observed if CD22 was excluded and a cutoff of 3 points or higher was used. Thus, the replacement of CD22 by SN8 in the original scoring system significantly increases its potential to discriminate between CLL and other B-cell lymphoproliferative diseases.},

We studied 126 well-characterized CLL patients by direct sequencing and DHPLC to detect TP53 mutations (exons 2-11). Most patients with 17p deletions also had TP53 mutations (81%). Mutations in the absence of 17p deletions were found in 4.5%. We found a shorter survival for patients with TP53 mutation (n = 18; P = .002), which was more pronounced when analyzed from the time point of mutation detection (6.8 vs 69 months, P < .001). The survival was equally poor for patients with deletion 17p plus TP53 mutation (7.6 months, n = 13), TP53 mutation only (5.5 months, n = 5), and 17p deletion only (5.4 months, n = 3). The prognostic impact of TP53 mutation (HR 3.71) was shown to be independent of stage, VH status, and 11q and 17p deletion in multivariate analysis. Serial samples showed evidence of clonal evolution and increasing clone size during chemotherapy, suggesting that there may be patients where this treatment is potentially harmful. TP53 mutations are associated with poor sur-vival once they occur in CLL. The de-monstration of clonal evolution under selective pressure supports the biologic significance of TP53 mutations in CLL.},

abstract = {Growth and survival of chronic B-cell tumors are favored by the malignant cell's capacity to respond to selected microenvironmental stimuli provided by nontumoral bystander cells. To investigate which mechanisms operate in these crosstalks and whether they are malignancy-related or reproduce the mechanisms used by normal B cells we have studied the expression and functional role of semaphorin CD100 (now called Sema4D) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and normal CD5+ B cells. We demonstrate here that (1) leukemic and normal CD5+ B lymphocytes uniformly express CD100; (2) the CD100 high-affinity receptor Plexin-B1 is expressed by bone marrow stromal cells, follicular dendritic cells, and activated T lymphocytes, and is thus available to CD100+ lymphocytes in different specific microenvironments; and (3) upon interaction between CD100 and Plexin-B1 both CLL and normal CD5+ B cells increase their proliferative activity and extend their life span. These findings establish that Plexin-B1 is an easily accessible receptor for CD100 within the immune system.

abstract = {Introduction: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) often has an extended disease course. With a median age at diagnosis of 72 years, newer treatment options with less toxicity than standard nucleoside analogue-based regimens are needed. Historically, few therapy options are available once CLL has become refractory to nucleoside analogues. Bendamustine has emerged as a feasible therapy for older and less fit CLL patients, with clinical efficacy in previously untreated and refractory CLL. Areas covered: This paper reviews several of the pivotal clinical trials that established the clinical activity of bendamustine in previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. The toxicity profile of bendamustine, primarily myelosuppression and infections, is reviewed and compared across different CLL populations. A review of the clinical data focuses on potential explanations for differences in response rates and duration of remission reported across studies and how this may impact the development of therapies for CLL. Expert opinion: Bendamustine is a valuable new agent for the management of CLL. Ongoing clinical trials are comparing bendamustine with standard CLL regimens in untreated disease, and investigating bendamustine combinations with novel targeted therapies and monoclonal antibodies. These studies will help to define the optimal role for bendamustine in CLL management. {\textcopyright} 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {Genetic and epigenetic intra-tumoral heterogeneity cooperate to shape the evolutionary course of cancer1. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a highly informative model for cancer evolution as it undergoes substantial genetic diversification and evolution after therapy2,3. The CLL epigenome is also an important disease-defining feature4,5, and growing populations of cells in CLL diversify by stochastic changes in DNA methylation known as epimutations6. However, previous studies using bulk sequencing methods to analyse the patterns of DNA methylation were unable to determine whether epimutations affect CLL populations homogeneously. Here, to measure the epimutation rate at single-cell resolution, we applied multiplexed single-cell reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing to B cells from healthy donors and patients with CLL. We observed that the common clonal origin of CLL results in a consistently increased epimutation rate, with low variability in the cell-to-cell epimutation rate. By contrast, variable epimutation rates across healthy B cells reflect diverse evolutionary ages across the trajectory of B cell differentiation, consistent with epimutations serving as a molecular clock. Heritable epimutation information allowed us to reconstruct lineages at high-resolution with single-cell data, and to apply this directly to patient samples. The CLL lineage tree shape revealed earlier branching and longer branch lengths than in normal B cells, reflecting rapid drift after the initial malignant transformation and a greater proliferative history. Integration of single-cell bisulfite sequencing analysis with single-cell transcriptomes and genotyping confirmed that genetic subclones mapped to distinct clades, as inferred solely on the basis of epimutation information. Finally, to examine potential lineage biases during therapy, we profiled serial samples during ibrutinib-associated lymphocytosis, and identified clades of cells that were preferentially expelled from the lymph node after treatment, marked by distinct transcriptional profiles. The single-cell integration of genetic, epigenetic and transcriptional information thus charts the lineage history of CLL and its evolution with therapy.},

abstract = {Compared with normal cells, tumor cells have undergone an array of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Often, these changes underlie cancer development, progression, and drug resistance, so the utility of model systems rests on their ability to recapitulate the genomic aberrations observed in primary tumors. Tumor-derived cell lines have long been used to study the underlying biologic processes in cancer, as well as screening platforms for discovering and evaluating the efficacy of anticancer therapeutics. Multiple -omic measurements across more than a thousand cancer cell lines have been produced following advances in high-throughput technologies and multigroup collaborative projects. These data complement the large, international cancer genomic sequencing efforts to characterize patient tumors, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Given the scope and scale of data that have been generated, researchers are now in a position to evaluate the similarities and differences that exist in genomic features between cell lines and patient samples. As pharmacogenomics models, cell lines offer the advantages of being easily grown, relatively inexpensive, and amenable to high-throughput testing of therapeutic agents. Data generated from cell lines can then be used to link cellular drug response to genomic features, where the ultimate goal is to build predictive signatures of patient outcome. This review highlights the recent work that has compared -omic profiles of cell lines with primary tumors, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of cancer cell lines as pharmacogenomic models of anticancer therapies.},

abstract = {Stromal cells are essential components of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment that regulate and support the survival of different tumors, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In this study, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in the promotion of survival and chemoresistance of human CLL cells in coculture with human BM-mesenchymal stromal cells (hBM-MSCs) of both autologous and allogeneic origin. The presence of BM-MSCs rescued CLL cells from apoptosis both spontaneously and following induction with various drugs, including Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Bendamustine, Prednisone and Hydrocortisone. The treatment with a combination of anti-Notch-1, Notch-2 and Notch-4 antibodies or $\gamma$-secretase inhibitor XII (GSI XII) reverted this protective effect by day 3, even in presence of the above-mentioned drugs. Overall, our findings show that stromal cell-mediated Notch-1, Notch-2 and Notch-4 signaling has a role in CLL survival and resistance to chemotherapy. Therefore, its blocking could be an additional tool to overcome drug resistance and improve the therapeutic strategies for CLL.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a malignancy of mature B cells driven by B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling and activated primarily in the lymph node. The Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib effectively inhibits BCR-dependent proliferation and survival signals and has emerged as a breakthrough therapy for CLL. However, complete remissions are uncommon and are achieved only after years of continuous therapy. We hypothesized that other signaling pathways that sustain CLL cell survival are only partially inhibited by ibrutinib. In normal B cells, Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling cooperates with BCR signaling to activate prosurvival NF-kB. Here, we show that an experimentally validated gene signature of TLR activation is overexpressed in lymph node–resident CLL cells compared with cells in the blood. Consistent with TLR activation, we detected phosphorylation of NF-kB, STAT1, and STAT3 in lymph node–resident CLL cells and in cells stimulated with CpG oligonucleotides in vitro. CpG promoted IRAK1 degradation, secretion of IL10, and extended survival of CLL cells in culture. CpG-induced TLR signaling was significantly inhibited by both an IRAK1/4 inhibitor and ibrutinib. Although inhibition of TLR signaling was incomplete with either drug, the combination achieved superior results, including more effective inhibition of TLR-mediated survival signaling. Our data suggest an important role for TLR signaling in CLL pathogenesis and in sustaining the viability of CLL cells during ibrutinib therapy. The combination of ibrutinib with a TLR pathway inhibitor could provide superior antitumor activity and should be investigated in clinical studies. Significance: CLL relies on the concomitant cooperation of B-cell receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling; inhibition of both pathways is superior to inhibition of either pathway alone.},

abstract = {Kinase inhibitors targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) are now prominent in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have focused here on interleukin 4 (IL-4), a cytokine that protects normal and malignant B cells from apoptosis and increases surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM) expression on murine splenic B cells. First, we have demonstrated that IL-4 treatment increased sIgM expression in vitro on peripheral blood B cells obtained from healthy individuals. In CLL, IL-4 target genes are overexpressed in cells purified from the lymph nodes of patients compared with cells derived from matched blood and bone marrow samples. As for normal B cells, IL-4 increased sIgM expression on CLL cells in vitro, especially in samples expressing unmutated V-genes. IL-4-induced sIgM expression was associated with increased receptor signalling activity, measured by anti-IgM-induced calcium mobilization, and with increased expression of CD79B messenger RNA and protein, and the "mature" glycoform of sIgM. Importantly, the ability of the BCR-associated kinase inhibitors idelalisib and ibrutinib, approved for treatment of CLL and other B-cell malignancies, to inhibit anti-IgM-induced signalling was reduced following IL-4 pretreatment in samples from the majority of patients. In contrast to stimulatory effects on sIgM, IL-4 decreased CXCR4 and CXCR5 expression; therefore, CLL cells, particularly within the progressive unmutated V-gene subset, may harness the ability of IL-4 to promote BCR signalling and B-cell retention within lymph nodes. Effects of IL-4 were mediated via JAK3/STAT6 and we propose a potential role for JAK inhibitors in combination with BCR kinase inhibitors for the treatment of CLL.},

Here we describe alternative, microenvironment-dependent mechanisms of Wnt activation in malignant B cells. We show that tumour cells specifically induce Notch2 activity in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) required for the transcription of the complement factor C1q. MSC-derived C1q in turn inhibits Gsk3-$\beta$ mediated degradation of $\beta$-catenin in CLL cells. Additionally, stromal Notch2 activity regulates N-cadherin expression in CLL cells, which interacts with and further stabilises $\beta$-catenin. Together, these stroma Notch2-dependent mechanisms induce strong activation of canonical Wnt signalling in CLL cells. Pharmacological inhibition of the Wnt pathway impairs microenvironment-mediated survival of tumour cells. Similarly, inhibition of Notch signalling diminishes survival of stroma-protected CLL cells in vitro and disease engraftment in vivo. Notch2 activation in the microenvironment is a pre-requisite for the activation of canonical Wnt signalling in tumour cells.},

abstract = {Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) regulates the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, which, in turn, plays a critical role in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) pathogenesis. The BTK-specific inhibitor Ibrutinib blocks BCR signaling and is now approved as effective B-CLL therapy. Chemokines, such as the homeostatic chemokine CXCL12, play a central role in B-CLL pathogenesis and progression, by regulating CLL cell interaction with the stromal microenvironment, leading to cells survival and proliferation. In this study, we investigated, in normal versus CLL B-lymphocytes, the role of BTK in signal transduction activated by the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis and its involvement in rapid integrin activation. We show that BTK is rapidly activated by CXCL12 in healthy as well as CLL B-lymphocytes, with a kinetic of tyr-phosphorylation coherent with rapid adhesion triggering. BTK inhibition prevents CXCL12-induced triggering of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) integrins. Furthermore, BTK inhibition blocks the activation of the small GTP-binding protein RhoA, controlling integrin affinity. Very importantly, we show that BTK tyr-phosphorylation and activation by CXCL12 depends on upstream activation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase. A comparative analysis of 36 B-CLL patients demonstrates that JAK2-dependent BTK regulatory role on integrin activation by CXCL12 is fully conserved in CLL cells. Finally, we show that the JAK2-BTK axis also regulates signaling to integrin activation by BCR. Thus, BTK and JAK protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) manifest a hierarchical activity both in chemokine-as well as BCR-mediated integrin activation and dependent adhesion, potentially suggesting the possibility of combined therapeutic approaches to B-CLL treatment.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a lymphoproliferative disease with a highly variable outcome. The prognosis of patients with CLL may be predicted using a number of biomarkers, including the level of CD38 expression at the leukemic cell surface. This study investigates the hypothesis that CD38 expression by CLL cells reflects interactions with nonmalignant cells within pseudofollicles in secondary lymphoid tissue where tumor cell proliferation is thought to occur. CD38 expression is higher in tissues that contain pseudofollicles compared with those that do not. In addition, we show that CD38 expression in CLL is dynamic, changes in response to contact with activated CD4 + T cells, and identifies cells that are primed to proliferate. Finally, we demonstrate close contact between activated CD4 + T cells and proliferating tumor in primary patient tissue. Proliferating tumor cells in lymph nodes express CD38, which is in turn associated with an increased number of CD31 + vascular endo- thelial cells. Although the factors resulting in colocalization of tumor, T cells, and endo- thelium remain unclear, the existence of these cellular clusters may provide an explanation for the association between CD38 expression and adverse outcome in CLL and suggests novel therapeutic targets. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.},

To investigate whether CD5 B lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients display the same function, we fused B lymphocytes from 23 CD5+ B-CLL with nonsecreting murine myeloma X-63 cells. Hybrids were derived from 18 of the 23 patients, but only hybrids from 13 patients were found to secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) (IgM kappa 4, IgM lambda 8, and only kappa light chain 1). Supernatants of these hybrids were tested against an extensive panel of antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect immunofluorescence, and hemagglutination. At the same time, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 15 of these patients, including most patients from whom secreting hybrids had not been obtained, were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Our results indicated that secreting heterohybrids from CLL B lymphocytes are frequently obtained; however, this is highly dependent on the light chain phenotype, since 8 of 9 lambda-expressing CLL produced hybrids secreting complete Igs, as compared with 4 of 12 kappa-expressing CLL. In addition, B lymphocytes of most patients from whom we failed to derive secreting hybrids also failed to secrete Ig on PMA stimulation. Secondly, CD5+ B-CLL lymphocytes were frequently committed to the production of natural autoantibodies, since in 8 of 15 cases (including hybrids and PMA stimulation) anti-Fc activity was found; three of these also displayed a multispecific binding pattern.},

abstract = {DNA methylation is a defining feature of mammalian cellular identity and is essential for normal development. Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos, display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80% of all CpGs being methylated. Despite recent advances, we still have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The cell-surface glycoprotein CD44 is expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but its functional role in this disease is poorly characterized. We therefore investigated the contribution of CD44 to CLL in a murine disease model, the Em-TCL1 transgenic mouse, and in CLL patients. Surface CD44 increased during murine CLL development. CD44 expression in human CLL was induced by stimulation with interleukin 4/soluble CD40 ligand and by stroma cell contact. Engagement of CD44 by its natural ligands, hyaluronic acid or chondroitin sulfate, protected CLL cells from apoptosis, while anti-CD44 small interfering RNAs impaired tumor cell viability. Deletion of CD44 during TCL1-driven murine leukemogenesis reduced the tumor burden in peripheral blood and spleen and led to a prolonged overall survival. The leukemic cells from these CD44 knockout animals revealed lower levels of antiapoptotic MCL1, a higher propensity to apoptosis, and a diminished B-cell receptor kinase response. The inhibitory anti-CD44 antibodies IM7 and A3D8 impaired the viability of CLL cells in suspension cultures, in stroma contact models, and in vivo via MCL1 reduction and by effector caspase activation. Taken together, CD44 expression in CLL is mediated by the tumor microenvironment. As a coreceptor, CD44 promotes leukemogenesis by regulating stimuli of MCL1 expression. Moreover, CD44 can be addressed therapeutically in CLL by specific antibodies.},

To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate every 3 years to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries; vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics; and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Data Base are presented for the most prevalent cancer types. Cancer-related and treatment-related short-term, long-term, and late health effects are also briefly described. More than 16.9 million Americans (8.1 million males and 8.8 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2019; this number is projected to reach more than 22.1 million by January 1, 2030 based on the growth and aging of the population alone. The 3 most prevalent cancers in 2019 are prostate (3,650,030), colon and rectum (776,120), and melanoma of the skin (684,470) among males, and breast (3,861,520), uterine corpus (807,860), and colon and rectum (768,650) among females. More than one-half (56%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and almost two-thirds (64%) are aged 65 years or older. People with a history of cancer have unique medical and psychosocial needs that require proactive assessment and management by follow-up care providers. Although there are growing numbers of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence-based resources are needed to optimize care. {\textcopyright} 2019 American Cancer Society},

Genomic aberrations of involved transcription factors underlie various B-cell disorders. Acquired somatic aberrations are associated with cancer, whereas germline variations predispose to both malignant and nonmalignant diseases. We review the opposing role of transcription factors during B-cell development in health and disease. We focus on early B-cell leukemia and discuss novel causative gene-environment cooperation and their implications for precision medicine. Childhood leu-kemia is frequently initiated during fetal hematopoiesis. Clinical silent preleukemic clones are detectable in cord blood of a large number of healthy newborns.

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is caused by the accumulation of malignant B cells due to a defect in apoptosis and the presence of small population of proliferating cells principally in the lymph nodes. The abnormal survival of CLL B cells is explained by a plethora of supportive stimuli produced by the surrounding cells of the microenvironment, including follicular dendritic cells (FDCs), and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). This crosstalk between malignant cells and normal cells can take place directly by cell-to-cell contact (assisted by adhesion molecules such as VLA-4 or CD100), indirectly by soluble factors (chemokines such as CXCL12, CXCL13, or CCL2) interacting with their receptors or by the exchange of material (protein, microRNAs or long non-coding RNAs) via extracellular vesicles. These different communication methods lead to different activation pathways (including BCR and NF$\kappa$B pathways), gene expression modifications (chemokines, antiapoptotic protein increase, prognostic biomarkers), chemotaxis, homing in lymphoid tissues and survival of leukemic cells. In addition, these interactions are bidirectional, and CLL cells can manipulate the normal surrounding stromal cells in different ways to establish a supportive microenvironment. Here, we review this complex crosstalk between CLL cells and stromal cells, focusing on the different types of interactions, activated pathways, treatment strategies to disrupt this bidirectional communication, and the prognostic impact of these induced modifications.},

A better understanding of the interaction between CLL cells and the tumor microenvironment has led to the development of in vitro models that mimic the mechanisms that support leukemic cell survival and proliferation in vivo. Employing these models as part of the pre-clinical evaluation of novel therapeutic agents enables a better approximation of their potential clinical efficacy. In this review we summarize the current literature describing how different aspects of the tumor microenvironment have been modeled in vitro and detail how these models have been employed to study the biology of the disease and potential efficacy of novel therapeutic agents.},

CLL is an incurable disease with a heterogeneous clinical course, for which the treatment decision still relies on conventional parameters (such as clinical stage and lymphocyte doubling time). During the past 5 years, relevant advances have been made in understanding CLL biology. Indeed, substantial progress has been made in the identification of the putative cell of origin of CLL, and comprehensive studies have dissected the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of CLL. Advances in clinical management include improvements in our understanding of the prognostic value of different genetic lesions, particularly those associated with chemoresistance and progression to highly aggressive forms of CLL, and the advent of new therapies targeting crucial biological pathways. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of CLL and how these genetic insights influence clinical management and the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease.},

abstract = {Purpose: There is a distinct connection between TP53 defects and poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It remains unclear whether patients harboring TP53 mutations represent a homogenous prognostic group. Patients and Methods: We evaluated the survival of patients with CLL and p53 defects identified at our institution by p53 yeast functional assay and complementary interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis detecting del(17p) from 2003 to 2010. Results: A defect of the TP53 gene was identified in 100 of 550 patients. p53 mutations were strongly associated with the deletion of 17p and the unmutated IgVH locus (both P < .001). Survival assessed from the time of abnormality detection was significantly reduced in patients with both missense (P < .001) and nonmissense p53 mutations (P = .004). In addition, patients harboring missense mutation located in p53 DNA-binding motifs (DBMs), structurally well-defined parts of the DNA-binding domain, manifested a clearly shorter median survival (12 months) compared with patients having missense mutations outside DBMs (41 months; P = .002) or nonmissense alterations (36 months; P = .005). The difference in survival was similar in the analysis limited to patients harboring mutation accompanied by del(17p) and was also confirmed in a subgroup harboring TP53 defect at diagnosis. The patients with p53 DBMs mutation (at diagnosis) also manifested a short median time to first therapy (TTFT; 1 month). Conclusion: The substantially worse survival and the short TTFT suggest a strong mutated p53 gain-of-function phenotype in patients with CLL with DBMs mutations. The impact of p53 DBMs mutations on prognosis and response to therapy should be analyzed in investigative clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2011 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {Background The prognosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients is largely determined by the karyotype of the malignant clone. We have investigated the gene expression profile associated with trisomy 12 (+12). Design Initially, unselected peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four patients with +12 were compared with 16 CLL controls using microarray analysis. Results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR with RNA from 61 patients (29 with +12, 32 CLL controls). Results Seven genes showing the strongest correlation with +12 in microarray analysis were selected for real-time PCR: HIP1R, MYF6, SLC2A6, CD9 (overexpressed); CD200, P2RY14, RASGRP3 (underexpressed). Four genes were significantly associated with +12: HIP1R (P < 0{\textperiodcentered}0001), MYF6 (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}007), P2RY14 (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}014), CD200 (P = 0{\textperiodcentered}028). Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis revealed that HIP1R expression was a highly sensitive and specific marker for +12 in CLL patients. MYF6 was exclusively expressed in normal or malignant B cells in peripheral blood but was poorly predictive for +12. As expected, a number of overexpressed genes are located on chromosome 12 (HIP1R, MYF6). Interestingly, both significantly underexpressed genes (P2RY14, CD200) reside on the long arm of chromosome 3 pointing to trans-repression in this region. Conclusions Analysis of the molecular signature of trisomy 12 in CLL resulted in: (i) identification of a surrogate marker for PCR (HIP1R); (ii) observation of a gene dosage effect; and (iii) detection of specific underexpression of genes located on chromosome 3. These results should help to improve diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients with CLL and trisomy 12. {\textcopyright} 2009 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.},

abstract = {Surface IgM (sIgM) has a key influence on the clinical behavior of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We now report that it exists in 2 forms with different N-glycosylation patterns in the $\mu$-constant region. One glycoform is similar to normal B cells in bearing mature complex glycans common to most cell-surface glycoproteins. The other is an immature mannosylated form more characteristic of $\mu$ chains in the endoplasmic reticulum. Unmutated CLL (U-CLL) expresses a higher proportion of mannosylated surface $\mu$ chains than mutated CLL. Normal B cells express only the mature glycoform but can express the immature form after persistent engagement of sIgM, suggesting that glycan modification is a consequence of antigen exposure. CLL cells express variable proportions of the mannosylated form and can revert to the mature form after incubation in vitro. Both glycoforms are able to signal after sIgM engagement in vitro, leading to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation. These findings support the concept that CLL cells are continuously exposed to antigen in vivo, driving the N-glycosylation pattern of expressed sIgM toward a mannosylated form, especially in U-CLL. Strikingly, this is reminiscent of follicular lymphoma, where mannosylated Ig is expressed constitutively via N-glycosylation sites in the variable region, suggesting a functional asset for this glycoform. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Background Patients with refractory or relapsed haematological malignancies have few treatment options and short survival times. Identification of effective therapies with genomic-based precision medicine is hampered by intratumour heterogeneity and incomplete understanding of the contribution of various mutations within specific cancer phenotypes. Ex-vivo drug-response profiling in patient biopsies might aid effective treatment identification; however, proof of its clinical utility is limited. Methods We investigated the feasibility and clinical impact of multiparametric, single-cell, drug-response profiling in patient biopsies by immunofluorescence, automated microscopy, and image analysis, an approach we call pharmacoscopy. First, the ability of pharmacoscopy to separate responders from non-responders was evaluated retrospectively for a cohort of 20 newly diagnosed and previously untreated patients with acute myeloid leukaemia. Next, 48 patients with aggressive haematological malignancies were prospectively evaluated for pharmacoscopy-guided treatment, of whom 17 could receive the treatment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in pharmacoscopy-treated patients, as compared with their own progression-free survival for the most recent regimen on which they had progressive disease. This trial is ongoing and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03096821. Findings Pharmacoscopy retrospectively predicted the clinical response of 20 acute myeloid leukaemia patients to initial therapy with 88{\textperiodcentered}1% accuracy. In this interim analysis, 15 (88%) of 17 patients receiving pharmacoscopy-guided treatment had an overall response compared with four (24%) of 17 patients with their most recent regimen (odds ratio 24{\textperiodcentered}38 [95% CI 3{\textperiodcentered}99–125{\textperiodcentered}4], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0013). 12 (71%) of 17 patients had a progression-free survival ratio of 1{\textperiodcentered}3 or higher, and median progression-free survival increased by four times, from 5{\textperiodcentered}7 (95% CI 4{\textperiodcentered}1–12{\textperiodcentered}1) weeks to 22{\textperiodcentered}6 (7{\textperiodcentered}4–34{\textperiodcentered}0) weeks (hazard ratio 3{\textperiodcentered}14 [95% CI 1{\textperiodcentered}37–7{\textperiodcentered}22], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0075). Interpretation Routine clinical integration of pharmacoscopy for treatment selection is technically feasible, and led to improved treatment of patients with aggressive refractory haematological malignancies in an initial patient cohort, warranting further investigation.

abstract = {ATM gene alteration is a frequent event in pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and occurs as monoallelic loss in the form of 11q23 deletion, with and without mutation in the remaining ATM allele. ATM is a principal DNA damage response gene and biallelic ATM alterations lead to ATM functional loss and chemoresistance. The introduction of new therapies, such as intensive chemoimmunotherapy and inhibition of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, has changed clinical responses for the majority of CLL tumors including those with 11q deletion, but it remains to be determined whether these strategies can prevent clonal evolution of tumors with biallelic ATM alterations. In this review we discuss ATM function and the consequences of its loss during CLL pathogenesis, differences in clinical behavior of tumors with monoallelic and biallelic ATM alterations, and we outline possible approaches for targeting the ATM null CLL phenotype. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the active role of the microenvironment in the pathogenesis of B cell lymphomas has been recognized, delivering signals that favor clonal expansion and drug resistance. We are only beginning to understand the complex cross talk between neoplastic B cells and the tissue microenvironment, for example in secondary lymphoid organs, but some key cellular and molecular players have emerged. Mesenchymal stromal cells, nurselike cells (NLC) and lymphoma-associated macrophages (LAM), in concert with T cells, natural killer cells and extracellular matrix components participate in the dialog with the neoplastic B cells. B cell receptor signaling, activation via TNF family members (i.e. BAFF, APRIL), and tissue homing chemokine receptors and adhesion molecules are important in the interaction between malignant B cells and their microenvironment. Disrupting this cross talk is an attractive novel strategy for treating patients with B cell malignancies. Here, we summarize the cellular and molecular interactions between B cell lymphoma/leukemia cells and their microenvironment, and the therapeutic targets that are emerging, focusing on small molecule inhibitors that are targeting B cell receptor-associated kinases SYK, BTK, and PI3Ks, as well as on immunomodulatory agents and T cell mediated therapies. Clinically relevant aspects of new targeted therapeutics will be discussed, along with an outlook into future therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {Interactions between chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment play a major function in the physiopathology of CLL. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are composed of exosomes and microparticles, play an important role in cell communication. However, little is known about their role in CLL / microenvironment interactions. In the present study, EVs purified by ultracentrifugation from BM mesenchymal stromal cell (BM-MSC) cultures were added to CLL B cells. After their integration into CLL B cells, we observed a decrease of leukemic cell spontaneous apoptosis and an increase in their chemoresistance to several drugs, including fludarabine, ibrutinib, idelalisib and venetoclax after 24 hours. Spontaneous (P=0.0078) and stromal cell-derived factor 1$\alpha$ -induced migration capacities of CLL B cells were also enhanced (P=0.0020). A microarray study highlighted 805 differentially expressed genes between leukemic cells cultured with or without EVs. Of these, genes involved in the B-cell receptor pathway such as CCL3/4, EGR1/2/3, and MYC were increased. Interestingly, this signature presents important overlaps with other microenvironment stimuli such as B-cell receptor stimulation, CLL/nurse-like cells co-culture or those provided by a lymph node microenvironment. Finally, we showed that EVs from MSCs of leukemic patients also rescue leukemic cells from spontaneous or drug-induced apoptosis. However, they induce a higher migration and also a stronger gene modification compared to EVs of healthy MSCs. In conclusion, we show that EVs play a crucial role in CLL B cells/BM microenvironment communication.},

abstract = {The key molecule for normal B cells is the surface Ig (sIg) of the B-cell receptor, which influences cell behaviour, even after neoplastic transformation. During B-cell maturation, sIg accumulates somatic mutations in the Ig variable region (V) genes and tumours retain these patterns, thereby revealing the point of differentiation of the B cell of origin. The importance of origin is strikingly illustrated in CLL where the two major subsets with distinctive clinical behaviour express either unmutated (U) or mutated (M) V genes. Biased selection of VDJ genes also occurs in CLL, allowing further identification of the normal B-cell counterparts, with U-CLL apparently derived from circulating na{\"{i}}ve B cells. Surface IgM of CLL is functional, with evidence for ongoing interaction with antigen in vivo. Signalling connects to cell survival, proliferation and migration, key determinants of tumour cell behaviour. Probing of B-cell receptor-mediated signalling pathways, either constitutively activated or open for activation, reveals dynamic, possibly repetitive, stimulatory events, likely to occur in tissue sites. Subtle differences in signal responsiveness between U-CLL or M-CLL subsets, together with microenvironmental factors, may explain clinical outcome. Knowledge of the critical signalling pathways should reveal the steps vulnerable to inhibition and allow development of a new range of therapeutic drugs, targeted particularly against the more aggressive subset, U-CLL.},

abstract = {The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib provides effective treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), despite extensive heterogeneity in this disease. To define the underlining regulatory dynamics, we analyze high-resolution time courses of ibrutinib treatment in patients with CLL, combining immune-phenotyping, single-cell transcriptome profiling, and chromatin mapping. We identify a consistent regulatory program starting with a sharp decrease of NF-$\kappa$B binding in CLL cells, which is followed by reduced activity of lineage-defining transcription factors, erosion of CLL cell identity, and acquisition of a quiescence-like gene signature. We observe patient-to-patient variation in the speed of execution of this program, which we exploit to predict patient-specific dynamics in the response to ibrutinib based on the pre-treatment patient samples. In aggregate, our study describes time-dependent cellular, molecular, and regulatory effects for therapeutic inhibition of B cell receptor signaling in CLL, and it establishes a broadly applicable method for epigenome/transcriptome-based treatment monitoring. Ibrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor, provides effective treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

High levels of Bcl-2 family anti-apoptotic proteins are responsible for apoptosis resistance. Besides anti-apoptotic proteins, the microenvironment provides substantial survival signals to CLL leukemic cells. However, in-depth knowledge on the role of individual Bcl-2 family members in the context of the microenvironment is still limited. We performed a comprehensive analysis of transcripts and proteins of 18 Bcl-2 family members using an " apoptosis array microfluidic card " in primary cells before and after stromal co-cultures. Our data showed that five of six anti-apoptotic members (excluding Bcl-b), two of three pro-apoptotic members (excluding Bok) and six of nine BH3-only members were present at detectable mRNA levels in CLL cells. Importantly, stromalmediated extended survival of CLL cells was strongly associated with elevated global transcription. Upon co-culturing with stromal cells, there was an early response of an increase in anti- (2/5) and pro-apoptotic protein (3/8) transcripts on day 1, while an increase in anti-apoptotic proteins was observed on day 3, with no significant change in pro-apoptotic proteins. Our study revealed a differential pattern of expression of both transcripts and proteins following stromal co-cultures, proposing a significance of Bcl-2 family members in the stromal microenvironment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Informa UK, Ltd.},

The rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) genes of CLL cells may be either germ-line in sequence or somatically mutated. Lack of Ig mutations defined a distinctly worse prognostic group of CLL patients raising the possibility that CLL comprises two distinct diseases. Using genomic-scale gene expression profiling, we show that CLL is characterized by a common gene expression "signature," irrespective of Ig mutational status, suggesting that CLL cases share a common mechanism of transformation and/or cell of origin. Nonetheless, the expression of hundreds of other genes correlated with the Ig mutational status, including many genes that are modulated in expression during mitogenic B cell receptor signaling. These genes were used to build a CLL subtype predictor that may help in the clinical classification of patients with this disease.},

This article weighs the benefits against potential harms, highlighting strategies for appropriate patient selection and administration. Methods: Relevant studies were identified upon literature review, which were combined with our clinical and institutional experience. Results: Fludarabine-based regimens result in an overall response rate of approximately 95% and of untreated CLL patients. Fludarabine also causes potentially irreversible grade 3 or 4 cytopenias and infection in the majority of patients. Furthermore, future hematopoietic cell mobilization may be difficult and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome and leukemia occur in at least 3% of patients. Conclusion: Fludarabine should be used judiciously in older patients, and avoided entirely in patients with renal insufficiency. Close monitoring of blood cell counts with appropriate dose reduction/omission is vital. Finally, alternatives such as pentostatin and bendamustine should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (or miRs) play a crucial role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) physiopathology and prognosis. In addition, circulating microRNAs in body fluids have been proposed as new biomarkers. We investigated the expression of matched cellular and serum circulating microRNA-150 by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) from purified CD19+ cells or from CLL serums obtained at diagnosis in a cohort of 273/252 CLL patients with a median follow-up of 78 months (range 7–380) and correlated it to other biological or clinical parameters. We showed that miR-150 was significantly overexpressed in CLL cells/serums compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.0001). Among CLL patients, a low cellular miR-150 expression level was associated with tumor burden, disease aggressiveness and poor prognostic factors. In contrast, a high level of serum miR-150 was associated with tumor burden markers and some markers of poor prognosis. Similarly, cellular and serum miR-150 also predicted treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival (OS) in an opposite manner: patients with low cellular/serum miR-150 levels have median TFS of 40/111 months compared with high-level patients who have a median TFS of 122/60 months (P < 0.0001/P = 0.0066). Similar results were observed for OS. We also found that cellular and serum miR-150 levels vary in an opposite manner during disease progression and that cellular miR-150 could be regulated by its release into the extracellular space. Cellular and serum levels of miR-150 are associated with opposite clinical prognoses and could be used to molecularly monitor disease evolution as a new prognostic factor in CLL.},

Several genetically engineered mousemodels have been generated, either mimicking genetic aberrations or deregulated gene expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The usefulness of such models in the study of the human disease may potentially be hampered by species-specific biological differences in the target cell of the oncogenic transformation. Specifically, do the genetic lesions or the deregulated expression of leukemia-associated genes faithfully recapitulate the spectrum of lymphoproliferations in humans? Do the CLL-like lymphoproliferations in the mouse have the phenotypic, histological, genetic, and clinical features of the human disease? Here we compare the various CLL mouse models with regard to disease phenotype, penetrance, and severity. We discuss similarities and differences of the murine lymphoproliferations compared with human CLL.

To provide a basis for studying epigenome deregulation in CLL, here we present genome-wide chromatin accessibility maps for 88 CLL samples from 55 patients measured by the ATAC-seq assay. We also performed ChIPmentation and RNA-seq profiling for ten representative samples. Based on the resulting data set, we devised and applied a bioinformatic method that links chromatin profiles to clinical annotations. Our analysis identified sample-specific variation on top of a shared core of CLL regulatory regions. IGHV mutation status—which distinguishes the two major subtypes of CLL—was accurately predicted by the chromatin profiles and gene regulatory networks inferred for IGHV-mutated versus IGHV-unmutated samples identified characteristic differences between these two disease subtypes. In summary, we discovered widespread heterogeneity in the chromatin landscape of CLL, established a community resource for studying epigenome deregulation in leukaemia and demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale chromatin accessibility mapping in cancer cohorts and clinical research.

abstract = {Many functional consequences of mutations on tumor phenotypes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are unknown. This may be in part due to a scarcity of information on the proteome of CLL. We profiled the proteome of 117 CLL patient samples with data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) and integrated the results with genomic, transcriptomic, ex vivo drug response and clinical outcome data. We found trisomy 12, IGHV mutational status, mutated SF3B1, trisomy 19, del(17)(p13), del(11)(q22.3), mutated DDX3X, and MED12 to influence protein expression (FDR < 5%). Trisomy 12 and IGHV status were the major determinants of protein expression variation in CLL as shown by principal component analysis (1055 and 542 differentially expressed proteins, FDR=5%). Gene set enrichment analyses of CLL with trisomy 12 implicated BCR/PI3K/AKT signaling as a tumor driver. These findings were supported by analyses of protein abundance buffering and protein complex formation, which identified limited protein abundance buffering and an upregulated protein complex involved in BCR, AKT, MAPK and PI3K signaling in trisomy 12 CLL. A survey of proteins associated with trisomy 12/IGHV-independent drug response linked STAT2 protein expression with response to kinase inhibitors including BTK and MEK inhibitors. STAT2 was upregulated in U-CLL, trisomy 12 CLL and required for chemokine/cytokine signaling (interferon response). This study highlights the importance of protein abundance data as a non-redundant layer of information in tumor biology, and provides a protein expression reference map for CLL.},

DESIGN AND METHODS Here, we investigated the ability of AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, to sensitize chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to chemotherapy in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia/mesenchymal stromal cell based or nurse-like cell based microenvironment co-culture model. RESULTS AMD3100 decreased CXCR4 expression signal (n=15, P=0.0078) and inhibited actin polymerization/migration in response to SDF-1$\alpha$ (n=8, P<0.01) and pseudoemperipolesis (n=10, P=0.0010), suggesting that AMD3100 interferes with chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell trafficking. AMD3100 did not have a direct effect on apoptosis when chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells were cultured alone (n=10, P=0.8812). However, when they were cultured with SDF-1$\alpha$, mesenchymal stromal cells or nurse-like cells (protecting them from apoptosis, P<0.001), chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell pre-treatment with AMD3100 significantly inhibited these protective effects (n=8, P<0.01) and decreased the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and FLIP. Furthermore, combining AMD3100 with various drugs (fludarabine, cladribine, valpro{\"{i}}c acid, bortezomib, flavopiridol, methylprednisolone) in our mesenchymal stromal cell co-culture model enhanced drug-induced apoptosis (n=8, P<0.05) indicating that AMD3100 could mobilize chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells away from their protective microenvironment, making them more accessible to conventional therapies. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, these data demonstrate that interfering with the SDF-1$\alpha$/CXCR4 axis by using AMD3100 inhibited chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell trafficking and microenvironment-mediated protective effects. Combining AMD3100 with other drugs may, therefore, represent a promising therapeutic approach to kill chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a malignancy of mature auto-reactive B cells. Genetic and functional studies implicate B-cell receptor signaling as a pivotal pathway in its pathogenesis. Full B-cell receptor activation requires tumor-microenvironment interactions in lymphoid tissues. Spleen tyrosine kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) $\delta$ isoform are essential for B-cell receptor signal transduction but also mediate the effect of other pathways engaged in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in the tissue-microenvironment. Orally bioavailable inhibitors of spleen tyrosine kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, or PI3K$\delta$, induce high rates of durable responses. Ibrutinib, a covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and idelalisib, a selective inhibitor of PI3K$\delta$, have obtained regulatory approval in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Ibrutinib and idelalisib are active in patients with high-risk features, achieving superior disease control in difficult-to-treat patients than prior best therapy, making them the preferred agents for chronic lymphocytic leukemia with TP53 aberrations and for patients resistant to chemoimmunotherapy. In randomized trials, both ibrutinib, versus ofatumumab, and idelalisib in combination with rituximab, versus placebo with rituximab improved survival in relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Responses to B-cell receptor inhibitors are mostly partial, and within clinical trials treatment is continued until progression or occurrence of intolerable side effects. Ibrutinib and idelalisib are, overall, well tolerated; notable adverse events include increased bruising and incidence of atrial fibrillation on ibrutinib and colitis, pneumonitis and transaminase elevations on idelalisib. Randomized trials investigate the role of B-cell receptor inhibitors in first-line therapy and the benefit of combinations. This review discusses the biological basis for targeted therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with B-cell receptor inhibitors, and summarizes the clinical experience with these agents.},

abstract = {The chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) immunoglobulin repertoire is biased and characterized by the existence of subsets of cases with closely homologous ("stereotyped") complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences. In the present series, 201 (21.9%) of 916 patients with CLL expressed IGHV genes that belonged to 1 of 48 different subsets of sequences with stereotyped heavy chain (H) CDR3. Twenty-six subsets comprised 3 or more sequences and were considered "confirmed." The remaining subsets comprised pairs of sequences and were considered "potential"; public database CLL sequences were found to be members of 9 of 22 "potential" subsets, thereby allowing us to consider them also "confirmed." The chance of belonging to a subset exceeded 35% for unmutated or selected IGHV genes (eg, IGHV1-69/3-21/4-39). Comparison to non-CLL public database sequences showed that HCDR3 restriction is "CLL-related." CLL cases with selected stereotyped immunoglobulins (IGs) were also found to share unique biologic and clinical features. In particular, cases expressing stereotyped IGHV4-39/IGKV1-39-1D-39 and IGHV4-34/IGKV2-30 were always IgG-switched. In addition, IGHV4-34/IGKV2-30 patients were younger and followed a strikingly indolent disease, contrasting other patients (eg, those expressing IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21) who experienced an aggressive disease, regardless of IGHV mutations. These findings suggest that a particular antigen-binding site can be critical in determining the clinical features and outcome for at least some CLL patients.},

abstract = {To better understand the stage(s) of differentiation reached by B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells and to gain insight into the potential role of antigenic stimulation in the development and diversification of these cells, we analyzed the rearranged V(H) genes expressed by 83 B-CLL cells (64 IgM+ and 19 non-IgM+). Our results confirm and extend the observations of a bias in the use of certain V(H), D, and J(H) genes among B-CLL cells. In addition, they indicate that the V. genes of $\sim$50% of the IgM+ B-CLL cells and $\sim$ 75% of the non-IgM+ B-CLL cells can exhibit somatic mutations. The presence of mutation varies according to the V(H) family expressed by the B-CLL cell (V(H)3 expressers displaying more mutation than V(H)1 and V(H)4 expressers). In addition, the extent of mutation can be sizeable with $\sim$32% of the IgM+ cases and $\sim$68% of the non- IgM+ cases differing by > 5% from the most similar germline gene. Approximately 20% of the mutated V(H) genes display replacement mutations in a pattern consistent with antigen selection. However, CDR3 characteristics (D and J(H) gene use and association and HCDR3 length, composition, and charge) suggest that selection for distinct B cell receptors (BCR) occurs in many more B-CLL cells. Based on these data, we suggest three prototypic BCR, representing the V(H) genes most frequently encountered in our study. These data suggest that many B-CLL cells have been previously stimulated, placing them in the 'experienced' or 'memory' CD5+ B cell subset.},

abstract = {B-cell accumulation and formation of ectopic germinal centers are characteristic changes in the diseased joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Earlier studies suggested that interactions between B lymphocytes and specialized synovial "nurse-like" cells peculiar to the RA synovium may be responsible for the homing and sustained survival of B cells in the synovium. However, in this study, we found that B cells spontaneously migrate beneath ordinary fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and then experience prolonged survival. FLSs isolated from joints of patients with osteoarthritis also supported this activity, termed B-cell pseudoemperipolesis. We found that FLSs constitutively expressed the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and that pertussis toxin or antibodies to the SDF-1 receptor (CXCR4) could inhibit B-cell pseudoemperipolesis. However, expression of SDF-1 is not sufficient, as dermal fibroblasts also expressed this chemokine but were unable to support B-cell pseudoemperipolesis unless previously stimulated with IL-4 to express CD106 (VCAM-1), a ligand for the alpha(4)beta(1) integrin, very-late-antigen-4 (VLA-4 or CD49d). Furthermore, mAb's specific for CD49d and CD106, or the synthetic CS1 fibronectin peptide, could inhibit B-cell pseudoemperipolesis. We conclude that ordinary FLSs can support B-cell pseudoemperipolesis via a mechanism dependent upon fibroblast expression of SDF-1 and CD106.},

We studied the genomic profile of 52 treatment-na{\"{i}}ve CLL patients. Methods Genetic analysis was performed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) using the SALSA P038 Probemix (MRC Holland, Amsterdam), which contains probes for 2p (MYCN,ALK,REL), 6q, 8p (TNFRSF10A/B), 8q (EIF3H,MYC), 9p21 (CDKN2A/B), 10q (PTEN), 11q (ATM, RDX, PPP2R1B, CADM1), chromosome 12, 13q14 (RB1, DLEU1/2/7, KCNRG, MIR15A), 14q, 17p (TP53) and chromosome 19, and for NOTCH1 7541-7542delCT, SF3B1 K700E, and MYD88 L265P mutations. Results The median age was 65 years (male:female=2:1). The median hemoglobin, total leukocyte, and platelet counts were 12.4 g/dL, 57.7×109/L, and 176.5×109/L, respectively. At least one genetic abnormality was observed in 34 (65%) patients. The most common abnormality was del(13q14) (deleted DLEU2 and DLEU1/RB1 genes), which was observed in 22 (42%) cases, followed by trisomy 12 [7 (13%) cases]. Del(11q) (deleted ATM, RDX11/PPP2R1B-4) and del(17p) (deleted TP53) were present in 5 (10%) and 2 (4%) cases, respectively. 19p13.2 (CDKN2D-2) amplification and NOTCH1 mutation were found in one case each. Conclusion Genetic abnormalities are commonly (65%) observed in CLL patients. Del(13q), which is associated with DLEU2 and DLEU1/RB1 gene deletion, was the most common. Compared with other abnormalities, del(11q) and del(17p) patients presented with cytopenia and higher Binet stage, while those with del(13q14) had a longer time to first treatment.},

For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of "mountains" (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of "hills" (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed ∼140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or "drive" tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},

The three largest subtypes are DLBCL (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma), FL (follicular lymphoma), and CLL/SLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma). For each subtype, different racial groups have different presentations, etiologies, and prognosis patterns. Methods: SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) data on DLBCL, FL, and CLL/SLL patients diagnosed between 1992 and 2010 were analyzed. Racial groups studied included NHW (non-Hispanic whites), HW (Hispanic whites), blacks, and API (Asians and Pacific Islanders). Patient characteristics, age-adjusted incidence rate, and survival were compared across races. Stratification and multivariate analysis were conducted. Results: There are significant racial differences for patients' characteristics, including gender, age at diagnosis, stage, lymph site, and age, and the patterns vary across subtypes. NHWs have the highest incidence rates for all three subtypes, followed by HWs (DLBCL and FL) and blacks (CLL/SLL). The dependence of the incidence rate on age and gender varies across subtypes. For all three subtypes, NHWs have the highest five-year relative survival rates, followed by HWs. When stratified by stage, racial difference is significant in multiple multivariate Cox regression analyses. Conclusions: Racial differences exist among DLBCL, FL, and CLL/SLL patients in the U.S. in terms of characteristics, incidence, and survival. The patterns vary across subtypes. More data collection and analysis are needed to more comprehensively describe and interpret the across-race and subtype differences.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) represents a neoplastic disorder caused primarily by defective programmed cell death (PCD), as opposed to increased cell proliferation. Defects in the PCD pathway also contribute to chemoresistance. The expression of several apoptosis-regulating proteins, including the Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, Mcl-1, Bax, Bak, and BAD; the Bcl-2–binding protein BAG-1; and the cell death protease Caspase-3 (CPP32), was evaluated by immunoblotting using 58 peripheral blood B-CLL specimens from previously untreated patients. Expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, BAG-1, Bax, Bak, and Caspase-3 was commonly found in circulating B-CLL cells, whereas the Bcl-XLand BAD proteins were not present. Higher levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 were strongly correlated with failure to achieve complete remission (CR) after single-agent therapy (fludarabine or chlorambucil) (P= .001), but the presence of only seven CRs among the 42 patients for whom follow-up data were available necessitates cautious interpretation of these observations. Higher levels of the anti-apoptotic protein BAG-1 were also marginally associated with failure to achieve CR (P= .04). Apoptosis-regulating proteins were not associated with patient age, sex, Rai stage, platelet count, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, or lymph node involvement, although higher levels of Bcl-2 and a high Bcl-2:Bax ratio were correlated with high numbers (>105/$\mu$L) of white blood cells (WBC) (P= .01; .007) and higher levels of Bak were weakly associated with loss of allelic heterozygosity at 13q14 (P= .04). On the basis of measurements of apoptosis induction by fludarabine using cultured B-CLL specimens, in vitro chemosensitivity data failed to correlate with in vivo clinical response rates (n = 42) and expression of the various apoptosis-regulating proteins. Although larger prospective studies are required before firm conclusions can be reached, these studies show the expression in B-CLLs of multiple apoptosis-regulating proteins and suggest that the relative levels of some of these, such as Mcl-1, may provide information about in vivo responses to chemotherapy. In vitro chemosensitivity data, however, do not appear to be particularly useful in predicting responses in B-CLL.},

abstract = {Activation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) by chemokines is fine-tuned by inside-out signaling mechanisms responsible for integrin-mediated adhesion modulation. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of qualitative variability of signaling mechanisms controlling LFA-1 activation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. We pursued a multiplexed comparative analysis of the role of the recently described chemokine-triggered rho-signaling module in human normal versus CLL B-lymphocytes. We found that the rho-module of LFA-1 affinity triggering is functionally conserved in normal B-lymphocytes. In contrast, in malignant B-lymphocytes isolated from patients with B-CLL, the role of the rho-module was not maintained, showing remarkable differences and variability. Specifically, RhoA and phospholipase D1 were crucially involved in LFA-1 affinity triggering by CXCL12 in all analyzed patients. In contrast, Rac1 and CDC42 involvement displayed a consistent patient-by-patient variability, with a group of patients showing LFA-1 affinity modulation totally independent of Rac1 and CDC42 signaling activity. Finally, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase isoform 1gamma (PIP5KC) was found without any regulatory role in all patients. The data imply that the neoplastic progression may completely bypass the regulatory role of Rac1, CDC42, and PIP5KC, and show a profound divergence in the signaling mechanisms controlling integrin activation in normal versus neoplastic lymphocytes, suggesting that patients with CLL can be more accurately evaluated on the basis of the analysis of signaling mechanisms controlling integrin activation. Our findings could potentially affect the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of CLL disorders.},

Consistent with this phenotype, NLCs failed to differentiate from blood mononuclear cells that were depleted of CD14+ cells or from isolated CD19 + cells. CD14 + blood cells of healthy donors could differentiate into cells with the morphology and phenotype of NLCs when cultured in direct contact with CLL B cells, but not with normal B cells. Despite expressing antigens in common with blood monocytes, monocyte-derived dendritic cells, and macrophages, NLCs expressed significantly higher levels of CD68 than these other cell types. Consistent with the notion that NLCs are present in vivo, CD14 + splenocytes from CLL patients have NLC morphology and express significantly higher levels 61 CD68 than CD14+ splenocytes from persons without known B-cell malignancy. These findings indicate that although NLCs may differentiate from blood monocytes, they probably represent a distinctive hematopoietic cell type that exists in vivo, differentiates from hematopoietic cD14 + cells in the context of CLL, and in turn protect CLL cells from apoptosis via a mechanism that is independent of CD106 (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1). The interaction between CLL cells and NLCs may represent a novel target for therapy of patients with this disease. {\textcopyright} 2002 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Purpose: To test whether eradication of minimal residual disease (MRD) in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by alemtuzumab is associated with a prolongation of treatment-free and overall survival. Patients and Methods: Ninety-one previously treated patients with CLL (74 men and 17 women; median age, 58 years [range, 32 to 75 years]; 44 were refractory to purine analogs) received a median of 9 weeks of alemtuzumab treatment between 1996 and 2003. Regular bone marrow assessments by MRD flow cytometry were performed with the aim of eradicating detectable MRD (< 1 CLL cell in 105 normal cells). Results: Responses according to National Cancer Institute-sponsored working group response criteria were complete remission (CR) in 32 patients (36%), partial remission (PR) in 17 patients (19%), and no response (NR) in 42 patients (46%). Twenty-two (50%) of 44 purine analog-refractory patients responded to alemtuzumab. Detectable CLL was eradicated from the blood and marrow in 18 patients (20%). Median survival was significantly longer in MRD-negative patients compared with those achieving an MRD-positive CR, PR, or NR. Patients achieving an MRD-negative CR had a longer treatment-free survival than patients with MRD-positive CRs, PR, or NR: MRD-negative CRs, not reached; MRD-positive CRs, 20 months; PRs, 13 months; NR, 6 months (P < .0001). Overall survival for the 18 patients with MRD-negative remissions was 84% at 60 months. Eight (47%) of the MRD-negative patients converted to MRD positivity at a median of 28 months. Conclusion: MRD-negative remission in CLL is achievable with alemtuzumab, leading to an improved overall and treatment-free survival. {\textcopyright} 2005 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable malignancy of mature B lymphocytes, involves blood, bone marrow, and secondary lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes (LN). A role of the tissue microenvironment in the pathogenesis of CLL is hypothesized based on in vitro observations, but its contribution in vivo remains ill-defined. To elucidate the effects of tumor-host interactions in vivo, we purified tumor cells from 24 treatment-naive patients. Samples were obtained concurrently from blood, bone marrow, and/or LN and analyzed by gene expression profiling. We identified the LN as a key site in CLL pathogenesis. CLL cells in the LN showed up-regulation of gene signatures, indicating B-cell receptor (BCR) and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B activation. Consistent with antigen-dependent BCR signaling and canonical nuclear factor-$\kappa$B activation, we detected phosphorylation of SYK and I$\kappa$B$\alpha$, respectively. Expression of BCR target genes was stronger in clinically more aggressive CLL, indicating more effective BCR signaling in this subtype in vivo. Tumor proliferation, quantified by the expression of the E2F and c-MYC target genes and verified with Ki67 staining by flow cytometry, was highest in the LN and was correlated with clinical disease progression. These data identify the disruption of tumor microenvironment interactions and the inhibition of BCR signaling as promising therapeutic strategies in CLL.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The treatment of relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has resulted in few durable remissions. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), an essential component of B-cell-receptor signaling, mediates interactions with the tumor microenvironment and promotes the survival and proliferation of CLL cells.\n\nMETHODS: We conducted a phase 1b-2 multicenter study to assess the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ibrutinib (PCI-32765), a first-in-class, oral covalent inhibitor of BTK designed for treatment of B-cell cancers, in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. A total of 85 patients, the majority of whom were considered to have high-risk disease, received ibrutinib orally once daily; 51 received 420 mg, and 34 received 840 mg.\n\nRESULTS: Toxic effects were predominantly grade 1 or 2 and included transient diarrhea, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection; thus, patients could receive extended treatment with minimal hematologic toxic effects. The overall response rate was the same in the group that received 420 mg and the group that received 840 mg (71%), and an additional 20% and 15% of patients in the respective groups had a partial response with lymphocytosis. The response was independent of clinical and genomic risk factors present before treatment, including advanced-stage disease, the number of previous therapies, and the 17p13.1 deletion. At 26 months, the estimated progression-free survival rate was 75% and the rate of overall survival was 83%.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Ibrutinib was associated with a high frequency of durable remissions in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma, including patients with high-risk genetic lesions.

abstract = {Deletions of the 13q14 chromosome region are associated with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and several other types of cancer, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene. In previous studies the minimal region of deletion (MDR) was mapped to a less than 300-kilobase (kb) interval bordered by the markers 173a12-82 and 138G4/1.3R. For the identification of the putative tumor suppressor gene, the entire MDR (approximately 347 kb) has been sequenced, and transcribed regions have been identified by exon trapping, EST-based full-length complementary DNA cloning, database homology searches, and computer-assisted gene prediction analyses. The MDR contains 2 pseudogenes and 3 transcribed genes: CAR, encoding a putative RING-finger containing protein; 1B4/Leu2, generating noncoding transcripts; and EST70/Leul, probably representing another noncoding gene (longest open reading frame of 78 codons). These genes have been sequenced in 20 B-CLL cases with 13q14 hemizygous deletion, and no mutations were found. Moreover, no somatic variants were found in the entire MDR analyzed for nucleotide substitutions by a combination of direct sequencing and fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis in 5 B-CLL cases displaying 13q14-monoallelic deletion. The nondeleted allele of the CAR and EST70/Leu1 genes was expressed in B-CLL specimens, including those with monoallelic loss, whereas no expression of 1B4/Leu2 was detectable in B-CLL, regardless of the 13q14 status. These results indicate that allelic loss and mutation of a gene within the MDR is an unlikely pathogenetic mechanism for B-CLL. However, haplo-insufficiency of one of the identified genes may contribute to tumorigenesis. {\textcopyright} 2001 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Our results confirmed frequency of XPO1 mutations. However, we found only 5 NOTCH1 mutations in 127 IGVH unmutated/ZAP70 + CLL samples (4%), and one mutation was found in IGVH mutated/ZAP70- CLL for a total percentage of 1.5%. Because 4 of 6 mutated samples also showed trisomy 12, we sequenced NOTCH1 in an additional 77 cases with trisomy 12 CLLs, including 47 IGVH unmutated/ZAP70 + cases. Importantly, we found 41.9% NOTCH1 mutation frequency in aggressive trisomy 12 CLL cases.

The presence of stereotyped and quasi-identical BCRs in different CLL patients suggests that recognition of specific antigens might drive CLL pathogenesis. Here we show that, in contrast to other B-cell neoplasias, CLL-derived BCRs induce antigen-independent cell-autonomous signalling, which is dependent on the heavy-chain complementarity-determining region (HCDR3) and an internal epitope of the BCR. Indeed, transferring the HCDR3 of a CLL-derived BCR provides autonomous signalling capacity to a non-autonomously active BCR, whereas mutations in the internal epitope abolish this capacity. Because BCR expression was required for the binding of secreted CLL-derived BCRs to target cells, and mutations in the internal epitope reduced this binding, our results indicate a new model for CLL pathogenesis, with cell-autonomous antigen-independent signalling as a crucial pathogenic mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the microenvironment influences gene expression patterns; however, knowledge is limited regarding the extent to which methylation changes with time and exposure to specific microenvironments. Using high-resolution 450K arrays, we provide the most comprehensive DNA methylation study of CLL to date, analyzing paired diagnostic/follow-up samples from IGHV-mutated/untreated and IGHV-unmutated/treated patients (n=36) and patient-matched peripheral blood and lymph node samples (n=20). On an unprecedented scale, we revealed 2239 differentially methylated CpG sites between IGHV-mutated and unmutated patients, with the majority of sites positioned outside annotated CpG islands. Intriguingly, CLL prognostic genes (for example, CLLU1, LPL, ZAP70 and NOTCH1), epigenetic regulator (for example, HDAC9, HDAC4 and DNMT3B), B-cell signaling (for example, IBTK) and numerous TGF-$\beta$ and NF-$\kappa$B/TNF pathway genes were alternatively methylated between subgroups. Contrary, DNA methylation over time was deemed rather stable with few recurrent changes noted within subgroups. Although a larger number of non-recurrent changes were identified among IGHV-unmutated relative to mutated cases over time, these equated to a low global change. Similarly, few changes were identified between compartment cases. Altogether, we reveal CLL subgroups to display unique methylation profiles and unveil methylation as relatively stable over time and similar within different CLL compartments, implying aberrant methylation as an early leukemogenic event. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western world. Survival of CLL cells depends on their close contact with stromal cells in lymphatic tissues, bone marrow and blood. This microenvironmental regulation of CLL cell survival involves the stromal secretion of chemo- and cytokines as well as the expression of adhesion molecules. Since CLL survival may also be driven by antigenic stimulation through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), we explored the hypothesis that these processes may be linked to each other. We tested if stromal cells could serve as an antigen reservoir for CLL cells, thus promoting CLL cell survival by stimulation through the BCR. As a proof of principle, we found that two CLL BCRs with a common stereotyped heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (previously characterized as "subset 1") recognize antigens highly expressed in stromal cells - vimentin and calreticulin. Both antigens are well-documented targets of autoantibodies in autoimmune disorders. We demonstrated that vimentin is displayed on the surface of viable stromal cells and that it is present and bound by the stereotyped CLL BCR in CLL-stroma co-culture supernatant. Blocking the vimentin antigen by recombinant soluble CLL BCR under CLL-stromal cell co-culture conditions reduces stromamediated anti-apoptotic effects by 20-45%. We therefore conclude that CLL BCR stimulation by stroma-derived antigens can contribute to the protective effect that the stroma exerts on CLL cells. This finding sheds a new light on the understanding of the pathobiology of this so far mostly incurable disease. {\textcopyright} 2010 Binder et al.},

abstract = {Tumour heterogeneity encompasses both the malignant cells and their microenvironment. While heterogeneity between individual patients is known to affect the efficacy of cancer therapy, most personalized treatment approaches do not account for intratumour heterogeneity. We addressed this issue by studying the heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas by single-cell RNA-sequencing and transcriptome-informed flow cytometry. We identified transcriptionally distinct malignant subpopulations and compared their drug-response and genomic profiles. Malignant subpopulations from the same patient responded strikingly differently to anti-cancer drugs ex vivo, which recapitulated subpopulation-specific drug sensitivity during in vivo treatment. Infiltrating T cells represented the majority of non-malignant cells, whose gene-expression signatures were similar across all donors, whereas the frequencies of T-cell subsets varied significantly between the donors. Our data provide insights into the heterogeneity of nodal B-cell lymphomas and highlight the relevance of intratumour heterogeneity for personalized cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Results of heavy-water labeling studies have challenged the notion that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) represents an accumulation of noncycling B cells. We examined leukemia cell turnover in E$\mu$-TCL1 transgenic (TCL1-Tg) mice, which develop a CLL-like disease at 8 to 12 months of age.We found that leukemia cells in these mice not only had higher proportions of proliferating cells but also apoptotic cells than did nonleukemic lymphocytes. We crossed TCL1-Tg with BAFF-Tg mice, which express high levels of CD257. TCL1xBAFF-Tg mice developed CLL-like disease at a significantly younger age and had more rapid disease progression and shorter survival than TCL1-Tg mice. Leukemia cells of TCL1xBAFF-Tg mice had similar proportions of proliferating cells, but fewer proportions of dying cells, than did the CLL cells of TCL1-Tg mice. Moreover, leukemia cells from either TCL1xBAFF-Tg or TCL1-Tg mice produced more aggressive disease when transferred into BAFF-Tg mice than into wild-type (WT) mice. Neutralization of CD257 resulted in rapid reduction in circulating leukemia cells. These results indicate that the leukemia cells of TCL1-Tg mice undergo high levels of spontaneous apoptosis that is offset by relatively high rates of leukemia cell proliferation, which might allow for acquisition of mutations that contribute to disease evolution. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society of Hematology.},

Most cells are currently cultured using two-dimensional (2D) methods but new and improved methods that implement three-dimensional (3D) cell culturing techniques suggest compelling evidence that much more advanced experiments can be performed yielding valuable insights. When performing 3D cell culture experiments, the cell environment can be manipulated to mimic that of a cell in vivo and provide more accurate data about cell-to-cell interactions, tumor characteristics, drug discovery, metabolic profiling, stem cell research, and other types of diseases. Scaffold based techniques such as hydrogel-based support, polymeric hard material-based support, hydrophilic glass fiber, and organoids are employed, and each provide their own advantages and applications. Likewise, there are also scaffold free techniques used such as hanging drop microplates, magnetic levitation, and spheroid microplates with ultra-low attachment coating. 3D cell culture has the potential to provide alternative ways to study organ behavior via the use of organoids and is expected to eventually bridge the gap between 2D cell culture and animal models. The present review compares 2D cell culture to 3D cell culture, provides the details surrounding the different 3D culture techniques, as well as focuses on the present and future applications of 3D cell culture.},

We propose a unifying model of cancer in which epigenetic dysregulation allows rapid selection for tumour cell survival at the expense of the host. Mechanisms involve both genetic mutations and epigenetic modifications that disrupt the function of genes that regulate the epigenome itself. Several exciting recent discoveries also point to a genome-scale disruption of the epigenome that involves large blocks of DNA hypomethylation, mutations of epigenetic modifier genes and alterations of heterochromatin in cancer (including large organized chromatin lysine modifications (LOCKs) and lamin-associated domains (LADs)), all of which increase epigenetic and gene expression plasticity. Our model suggests a new approach to cancer diagnosis and therapy that focuses on epigenetic dysregulation and has great potential for risk detection and chemoprevention. {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

Trisomy 12 is the second most frequent aberration detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization at the time of diagnosis (10-25%), and it confers an intermediate prognostic risk, with a median time to first treatment of 33 months and a median overall survival of 114 months. Here, we review the unique morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and trisomy 12. These patients carry a significantly higher expression of CD19, CD22, CD20, CD79b, CD24, CD27, CD38, CD49d, sIgM, sIgk, and sIg$\lambda$ and lower expression of CD43 compared with patients with normal karyotype. Circulating cells show increased expression of the integrins CD11b, CD18, CD29, and ITGB7, and of the adhesion molecule CD323. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and trisomy 12 frequently have unmutated IGHV, ZAP-70 positivity, and closely homologous stereotyped B-cell receptors. They rarely show TP53 mutations but frequently have NOTCH1 mutations, which can be identified in up to 40% of those with a rapidly progressive clinical course.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells are hyporesponsive or refractory to mitogens and growth factors in vitro. This study examined whether transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), a potent inhibitor of lymphocyte proliferation may play a role in the growth regulation of CLL B cells. CLL B cells from all donors treated expressed detectable TGF-beta 1 mRNA. In vitro release of TGF-beta by unstimulated cultures, or cultures stimulated by antibody to cell surface immunoglobulin (anti-mu) plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was higher in CLL than in normal B cells. High levels of TGF-beta activity were also detected in plasma samples of CLL patients. The role of TGF-beta in growth regulation of CLL B cells was tested in assays using different B cell activators. Purified neoplastic B cells from most CLL patients proliferated in response to anti-mu, or the combination of anti-mu plus PMA. Levels of CLL B cell proliferation were lower than observed in normal B cells. Some CLL were refractory to these stimuli. Antibody to CD40 induced proliferation of CLL B cells from all donors tested when presented on Fc gamma RII (CDw32)-expressing L cells. Neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta increased CLL B cell proliferation in the absence or presence of additional stimuli. These effects were dose dependent and specific. Exogenous TGF-beta completely inhibited CLL B cell proliferation induced by anti-mu, PMA, and anti-TGF-beta. CLL B cell proliferation induced by anti-CD40 was reduced by exogenous TGF-beta. However, even at high doses, TGF-beta did not completely inhibit the anti-CD40 effect. In summary, TGF-beta is overexpressed in CLL. CLL B cells are sensitive to TGF-beta and this cytokine functions as an autocrine growth inhibitor accounting at least in part for reduced proliferative responses of these leukemic cells and for the slow progression of the malignant process in vivo.},

abstract = {GC content bias describes the dependence between fragment count (read coverage) and GC content found in Illumina sequencing data. This bias can dominate the signal of interest for analyses that focus on measuring fragment abundance within a genome, such as copy number estimation (DNA-seq). The bias is not consistent between samples; and there is no consensus as to the best methods to remove it in a single sample. We analyze regularities in the GC bias patterns, and find a compact description for this unimodal curve family. It is the GC content of the full DNA fragment, not only the sequenced read, that most influences fragment count. This GC effect is unimodal: both GC-rich fragments and AT-rich fragments are underrepresented in the sequencing results. This empirical evidence strengthens the hypothesis that PCR is the most important cause of the GC bias. We propose a model that produces predictions at the base pair level, allowing strand-specific GC-effect correction regardless of the downstream smoothing or binning. These GC modeling considerations can inform other high-throughput sequencing analyses such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq.},

The nature of the antigens has, however, not been characterized, although examples of autoantigens have been demonstrated. We have analyzed a panel of 28 CLL cell lines and primary cultures, producing monoclonal Ig with different Ig heavy-chain variable region gene usage and mutational status, including several complementarity determining region 3 homology subset members. Using mass-spectrometry, immunoassays, or protein macroarrays, we have discovered novel antigens binding to CLL Igs. These antigens included cytoskeletal proteins vimentin, filamin B, and cofilin-1, but also phosphorylcholine-containing antigens (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharides and oxidized low-density lipoprotein [oxLDL]). Additional new antigens identified were cardiolipin and proline-rich acidic protein-1. Remarkably, these antigens represent molecular motifs exposed on apoptotic cells/blebs and bacte-ria, and several CLL Igs bound to apoptotic Jurkat cells. In conclusion, these intriguing data, showing a limited target structure recognition, indicate that CD5+ CLL B cells are derived from a cell compartment that produces "natural antibodies," which may be instrumental in elimination and scavenging of apoptotic cells and pathogenic bacteria. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {CLL remains an incurable disease in spite of the many new compounds being studied. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) induces apoptosis in all CLL cell types and could constitute an efficient therapy. To further explore this, we have studied the influence of stromal cells, key components of the CLL microenvironment, on the response of CLL cells to ATO. Bone marrow stromal cells induced CLL cell resistance to 2 $\mu$M ATO and led to activation of Lyn, ERK, PI3K and PKC, as well as NF-$\kappa$B and STAT3. Mcl-1, Bcl-xL, and Bfl-1 were also upregulated after the co-culture. Inhibition experiments indicated that PI3K and PKC were involved in the resistance to ATO induced by stroma. Moreover, idelalisib and sotrastaurin, specific inhibitors for PI3K$\delta$ and PKC$\beta$, respectively, inhibited Akt phosphorylation, NF-$\kappa$B/STAT3 activation and Mcl-1 upregulation, and rendered cells sensitive to ATO. Mcl-1 was central to the mechanism of resistance to ATO, since: 1) Mcl-1 levels correlated with the CLL cell response to ATO, and 2) blocking Mcl-1 expression or function with specific siRNAs or inhibitors overcame the protecting effect of stroma. We have therefore identified the mechanism involved in the CLL cell resistance to ATO induced by bone marrow stroma and show that idelalisib or sotrastaurin block this mechanism and restore sensibility to ATO. Combination of ATO with these inhibitors may thus constitute an efficient treatment for CLL.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, the active role of the microenvironment in the pathogenesis, development and drug resistance of B cell malignancies has been clearly established. It is known that the tissue microenvironment promotes proliferation and drug resistance of leukemic cells suggesting that successful treatments of B cell malignancies must target the leukemic cells within these compartments. However, the cross-talk occurring between cancer cells and the tissue microenvironment still needs to be fully elucidated. In solid tumors, this lack of knowledge has led to the development of new and more complex in vitro models able to successfully mimic the in vivo settings, while only a few simplified models are available for haematological cancers, commonly relying only on the co-culture with stabilized stromal cells and/or the addition of limited cocktails of cytokines. Here, we will review the known cellular and molecular interactions occurring between monoclonal B lymphocytes and their tissue microenvironment and the current literature describing innovative in vitro models developed in particular to study chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We will also elaborate on the possibility to further improve such systems based on the current knowledge of the key molecules/signals present in the microenvironment. In particular, we think that future models should be developed as 3D culture systems with a higher level of cellular and molecular complexity, to replicate microenvironmental-induced signaling. We believe that innovative 3D-models may therefore improve the knowledge on pathogenic mechanisms leading to the dissemination and homing of leukemia cells and consequently the identification of therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Disruption of the interaction of bromo and extraterminal (BET) proteins with acetylated histones using small molecule inhibitors suppresses Myc-driven cancers and TLR-induced inflammation in mouse models. The predominant mechanism of BET inhibitor action is to suppress BET-mediated recruitment of positive transcription elongation factor b and, thus, transcription elongation. We investigated the effects of BET inhibitor I-BET151 on transcriptional responses to TLR4 and TNF in primary human monocytes and also on responses to cytokines IFN-$\beta$, IFN-$\gamma$, IL-4, and IL-10, which activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and are important for monocyte polarization and inflammatory diseases. I-BET151 suppressed TLR4- and TNF-induced IFN responses by diminishing both autocrine IFN-$\beta$ expression and transcriptional responses to IFN-$\beta$. I-BET151 inhibited cytokine-induced transcription of STAT targets in a gene-specific manner without affecting STAT activation or recruitment. This inhibition was independent of Myc or other upstream activators. IFN-stimulated gene transcription is regulated primarily at the level of transcription initiation. Accordingly, we found that I-BET151 suppressed the recruitment of transcriptional machinery to the CXCL10 promoter and an upstream enhancer. Our findings suggest that BET inhibition reduces inflammation partially through suppressing cytokine activity and expands the understanding of the inhibitory and potentially selective immunosuppressive effects of inhibiting BET proteins.},

In this study we evaluated whether MSCs influence in vitro CLL cell survival. MSCs were isolated from the bone marrow of 46 CLL patients and were characterized by flow cytometry analysis. Following co-culture of MSCs and leukemic B cells, we demonstrated that MSCs were able to improve leukemic B cell viability, this latter being differently dependent from the signals coming from MSCs. In addition, we found that the co-culture of MSCs with leukemic B cells induced an increased production of IL-8, CCL4, CCL11, and CXCL10 chemokines. As far as drug resistance is concerned, MSCs counteract the cytotoxic effect of Fludarabine/Cyclophosphamide administration in vivo, whereas they do not protect CLL cells from the apoptosis induced by the kinase inhibitors Bafetinib and Ibrutinib. The evidence that leukemic clones are conditioned by environmental stimuli suggest new putative targets for therapy in CLL patients.},

abstract = {Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (BTK), a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase, is a component of the B-cell receptor signaling pathway. Ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, has demonstrated a significant clinical activity against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in early clinical trials. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of action would shed light on CLL pathophysiology and provide additional opportunities for the development of new therapies. In this study, we have chosen an in vivo approach by employing an ongoing phase 1b trial of ibrutinib. We prospectively collected and analyzed serial samples from the CLL patients before and after the initiation of ibrutinib. We found that the blockage of cell proliferation was one of the primary effects of ibrutinib against leukemic CLL cells in vivo. Using a co-culture system that induces CLL proliferation in vitro, analysis of several parameters, including Ki-67 expression and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, revealed that the proliferation of CLL cells was directly inhibited by ibrutinib. Furthermore, activities of BTK and phospholipase C$\gamma$2 as well as downstream signaling molecules, AKT and ERK, were all coordinately downregulated over time in ibrutinib-treated patients. Our findings suggest that the cell proliferation is one of the essential properties of CLL. Blocking cell proliferation via inhibition of BTK-mediated signaling may contribute to clinical responses in ibrutinib-treated patients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {Purpose: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 17p deletion typically progresses quickly and is refractory to most conventional therapies. However, some del(17p) patients do not progress for years, suggesting that del(17p) is not the only driving event in CLL progression. We hypothesize that other concomitant genetic abnormalities underlie the clinical heterogeneity of del(17p) CLL. Experimental Design: We profiled the somatic mutations and copy number alterations (CNA) in a large group of del(17p) CLLs as well as wild-type CLL and analyzed the genetic basis of their clinical heterogeneity. Results: We found that increased somatic mutation number associates with poor overall survival independent of 17p deletion (P = 0.003). TP53 mutation was present in 81% of del(17p) CLL, mostly clonal (82%), and clonal mutations with del(17p) exhibit shorter overall survival than subclonal mutations with del(17p) (P = 0.019). Del(17p) CLL has a unique driver mutation profile, including NOTCH1 (15%), RPS15 (12%), DDX3X (8%), and GPS2 (6%). We found that about half of del(17p) CLL cases have recurrent deletions at 3p, 4p, or 9p and that any of these deletions significantly predicts shorter overall survival. In addition, the number of CNAs, but not somatic mutations, predicts shorter time to treatment among patients untreated at sampling. Indolent del(17p) CLLs were characterized by absent or subclonal TP53 mutation and few CNAs, with no difference in somatic mutation number. Conclusions: We conclude that del(17p) has a unique genomic profile and that clonal TP53 mutations, 3p, 4p, or 9p deletions, and genomic complexity are associated with shorter overall survival.},

These agents, including the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor PCI-32765, display an unexpected response in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL): a rapid and sustained reduction of lymphadenopathy accompanied by transient lymphocytosis, which is reversible upon temporary drug deprivation. We hypothesized that this clinical response reflects impaired integrin-mediated adhesion and/or migration. Here, we show that PCI-32765 strongly inhibits BCR-controlled signaling and integrin $\alpha$ 4$\beta$ 1- mediated adhesion to fibronectin and VCAM-1 of lymphoma cell lines and primary CLL cells. Furthermore, PCI-32765 also inhibits CXCL12-, CXCL13-, and CCL19-induced signaling, adhesion, and migration of primary CLLcells. Our data indicate that inhibition of BTK by PCI-32765 overcomes BCR- and chemokine-controlled integrin-mediated retention and homing of malignant B cells in their growth- and survival-supporting lymph node and bone marrow microenvironment, which results in clinically evident CLL regression. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {Purpose: TP53 mutations have been described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and have been associated with poor prognosis in retrospective studies. We aimed to address the frequency and prognostic value of TP53 abnormalities in patients with CLL in the context of a prospective randomized trial. Patients and Methods: We analyzed 529 CLL samples from the LRF CLL4 (Leukaemia Research Foundation Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 4) trial (chlorambucil v fludarabine with or without cyclophosphamide) at the time of random assignment for mutations in the TP53 gene. TP53 mutation status was correlated with response and survival data. Results: Mutations of TP53 were found in 40 patients (7.6%), including 25 (76%) of 33 with 17p deletion and 13 (3%) of 487 without that deletion. There was no significant correlation between TP53 mutations and age, stage, IGHV gene mutations, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, or any other chromosomal abnormality other than 17p deletion, in which concordance was high (96%). TP53 mutations were significantly associated with poorer overall response rates (27% v 83%; P < .001) and shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 5-year PFS: 5% v 17%; 5-year OS: 20% v 59%; P < .001 for both). Multivariate analysis that included baseline clinical variables, treatment, and known adverse genetic factors confirmed that TP53 mutations have added prognostic value. Conclusion: TP53 mutations are associated with impaired response and shorter survival in patients with CLL. Analysis of TP53 mutations should be performed in patients with CLL who have progressive disease before starting first-line treatment, and those with mutations should be selected for novel experimental therapies. {\textcopyright} 2011 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients often have abnormal expansions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and this can be associated with progressive disease. To characterise the key T-cell populations involved in this phenomenon, we used flow cytometry and 11 phenotypic markers to study 74 CLL patients and 14 controls. T cells of CLL patients were more phenotypically complex than those of healthy controls with significant increases in the frequencies of CD4 and CD8 memory T cells expressing exhaustion-, activation- and senescence-associated markers. Multivariate analysis of 111 different T-cell subsets showed that high frequencies of four subsets (three CD8 and one CD4) were associated with shorter progression-free survival. The most significant association was with CD4+ HLA-DR+ PD-1+ T cells, and patients could be stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the frequency of these T cells. The expansion of this CD4+ subset could not be accounted for by age, cytomegalovirus infection or increases in Treg cells. Overall, these results highlight two relatively simple biomarkers, percentage CD8+ and percentage CD4+ PD-1+ HLA-DR+ T cells, which can be used to risk-stratify CLL patients, independent of other tumour-associated markers. They also provide further evidence for the pivotal role of T cells in modulating the pathology of CLL.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a B-cell malignancy, which is associated with profound alterations and defects in the immune system and a prevalent dependency on the microenvironmental niche. An abnormal T-cell compartment in the blood of CLL patients was already reported 40 years ago. Since then, our knowledge of T-cell characteristics in CLL has grown steadily, but the question of whether T-cells act as pro-tumoral bystander cells or possess anti-tumoral activity is still under debate. Increased numbers of CD4 + T-helper cell subsets are present in the blood of CLL patients, and T-helper cell cytokines have been shown to stimulate CLL cell survival and proliferation in vitro. In line with this, survival and growth of CLL cells in murine xenograft models have been shown to rely on activated CD4 + T-cells. This led to the hypothesis that T-cells are tumor-supportive in CLL. In recent years, evidence for an enrichment of antigen-experienced CD8 + T-cells in CLL has accumulated, and these cells have been shown to control leukemia in a CLL mouse model. Based on this, it was suggested that CD8 + T-cells recognize CLL-specific antigens and exert an anti-leukemia function. As described for other cancer entities, T-cells in CLL express multiple inhibitory receptors, such as PD-1, and lose their functional capacity, leading to an exhaustion phenotype which has been shown to be more severe in T-cells from secondary lymphoid organs compared with peripheral blood. This exhausted phenotype has been suggested to be causative for the poor response of CLL patients to CAR T-cell therapies. In addition, T-cells have been shown to be affected by drugs that are used to treat CLL, which likely impacts therapy response. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge about alterations of T-cells in CLL, including their distribution, function, and exhaustion state in blood and lymphoid organs, and touches also on the topic of how CLL drugs impact on the T-cell compartment and recent results of T-cell-based immunotherapy. We will discuss potential pathological roles of T-cell subsets in CLL and address the question of whether they foster progression or control of disease.},

abstract = {We examined expression of B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) on chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells and nurselike cells (NLCs), which differentiate from CD14+ cells when cultured with CLL B cells. NLCs expressed significantly higher levels of APRIL than monocytes and significantly higher levels of BAFF and APRIL than CLL B cells. Also, the viability of CLL B cells cultured with NLCs was significantly reduced when CLL B cells were cultured with decoy receptor of B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which can bind both BAFF and APRIL, but not with BAFF receptor:Fc (BAFF-R:Fc), which binds only to BAFF. The effect(s) of BAFF or APRIL on leukemia cell survival appeared additive and distinct from that of stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), which in contrast to BAFF or APRIL induced leukemia cell phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 [ERK1/2]) and AKT. Conversely, BAFF and APRIL, but not SDF-1alpha, induced CLL-cell activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB1 (NF-kappaB1) and enhanced CLL-cell expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1. However, BAFF, but not APRIL, also induced CLL-cell activation of NF-kappaB2. We conclude that BAFF and APRIL from NLCs can function in a paracrine manner to support leukemia cell survival via mechanisms that are distinct from those of SDF-1alpha, indicating that NLCs use multiple distinct pathways to support CLL-cell survival.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Fluorescence in situ hybridization has improved the detection of genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We used this method to identify chromosomal abnormalities in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and assessed their prognostic implications. METHODS Mononuclear cells from the blood of 325 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for deletions in chromosome bands 6q21, 11q22-23, 13q14, and 17p13; trisomy of bands 3q26, 8q24, and 12q13; and translocations involving band 14q32. Molecular cytogenetic data were correlated with clinical findings. RESULTS Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 268 of 325 cases (82 percent). The most frequent changes were a deletion in 13q (55 percent), a deletion in 11q (18 percent), trisomy of 12q (16 percent), a deletion in 17p (7 percent), and a deletion in 6q (7 percent). Five categories were defined with a statistical model: 17p deletion, 11q deletion, 12q trisomy, normal karyotype, and 13q deletion as the sole abnormality; the median survival times for patients in these groups were 32, 79, 114, 111, and 133 months, respectively. Patients in the 17p- and 11q-deletion groups had more advanced disease than those in the other three groups. Patients with 17p deletions had the shortest median treatment-free interval (9 months), and those with 13q deletions had the longest (92 months). In multivariate analysis, the presence or absence of a 17p deletion, the presence or absence of an 11q deletion, age, Binet stage, the serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and the white-cell count gave significant prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS Genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia are important independent predictors of disease progression and survival. These findings have implications for the design of risk-adapted treatment strategies.},

By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains <20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance. {\textcopyright} 2011 Fabbri et al.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. RESULTS: We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLC$\gamma$2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLC$\gamma$2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLC$\gamma$2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a neoplastic disease of unknown aetiology characterised by an absolute lymphocytosis in peripheral blood and bone marrow. The disease is diagnosed most commonly in the elderly with the median age at diagnosis being about 65 years. The purine nucleoside analogues (PNAs) fludarabine, cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine) and pentostatin (2′-deoxycoformycin) are highly active in CLL, both in previously treated and in refractory or relapsed patients. These three agents share similar chemical structures and mechanisms of action such as induction of apoptosis. However, they also exhibit significant differences, especially in their interactions with enzymes involved in adenosine and deoxyadenosine metabolism. Recent randomised studies suggest that fludarabine and cladribine have similar activity in CLL. However, clinical observations indicate the existence of cross-resistance between fludarabine and cladribine. Patients who received PNAs as their initial therapy and achieved long-lasting response can be successfully retreated with the same agent. PNAs administered in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents and/or monoclonal antibodies may produce higher response rates, including complete response (CR) or molecular CR, compared with PNAs alone or other treatment regimens. Management decisions are more difficult in elderly patients because of the apparent increase in toxicity of PNAs in this population. In elderly patients, we recommend chlorambucil as the first-line treatment, with PNAs in lower doses in refractory or relapsed patients. Myelosuppression and infections, including opportunistic varieties, are the most frequent adverse effects in patients with CLL treated with PNAs. Therefore, some investigators recommend routine antibacterial and antiviral prophylaxis during and after PNA treatment. This review presents current results and treatment strategies with the use of PNAs in CLL, especially in elderly patients. {\textcopyright} 2005 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable adult disease of unknown etiology. Understanding the biology of CLL cells, particularly cell maturation and growth in vivo, has been impeded by lack of a reproducible adoptive transfer model. We report a simple, reproducible system in which primary CLL cells proliferate in nonobese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficiency/$\gamma$cnull mice under the influence of activated CLL-derived T lymphocytes. By cotransferring autologous T lymphocytes, activated in vivo by alloantigens, the survival and growth of primary CFSE-labeled CLL cells in vivo is achieved and quantified. Using this approach, we have identified key roles for CD4+ T cells in CLL expansion, a direct link between CD38 expression by leukemic B cells and their activation, and support for CLL cells preferentially proliferating in secondary lymphoid tissues. The model should simplify analyzing kinetics of CLL cells in vivo, deciphering involvement of nonleukemic elements and nongenetic factors promoting CLL cell growth, identifying and characterizing potential leukemic stem cells, and permitting preclinical studies of novel therapeutics. Because autologous activated T lymphocytes are 2-edged swords, generating unwanted graph-versus-host and possibly autologous antitumor reactions, the model may also facilitate analyses of T-cell populations involved in immune surveillance relevant to hematopoietic transplantation and tumor cytoxicity.},

The disease is believed to be driven by B-cell receptor (BCR) signals generated by external antigens and/or cell-autonomous BCR interactions, but direct in vivo evidence for this is still lacking. To further define the role of the BCR pathway in the development and progression of CLL, we evaluated the capacity of different types of antigen/BCR interactions to induce leukemia in the E$\mu$-TCL1 transgenic mouse model. We show that cell autonomous signaling capacity is a uniform characteristic of the leukemia-derived BCRs and represents a prerequisite for CLL development. Low-affinity BCR interactions with autoantigens generated during apoptosis are also positively selected, suggesting that they contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease. In contrast, high-affinity BCR interactions are not selected, regardless of antigen form or presentation. We also show that the capacity of the leukemic cells to respond to cognate antigen correlates inversely with time to leukemia development, suggesting that signals induced by external antigen increase the aggressiveness of the disease. Collectively, these findings provide in vivo evidence that the BCR pathway drives the development and can influence the clinical course of CLL.},

The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein bromodomain 4 is essential for the transcriptional activity of NF-$\kappa$B. Here, we demonstrate that treatment with the BET protein bromodomain antagonist (BA) JQ1 attenuates MYC and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)4/6, inhibits the nuclear RelA levels and the expression of NF-$\kappa$B target genes, including Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) in MCL cells. Although lowering the levels of the antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma (BCL)2 family proteins, BA treatment induces the proapoptotic protein BIM and exerts dose-dependent lethality against cultured and primary MCL cells. Cotreatment with BA and the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib synergistically induces apoptosis of MCL cells. Compared with each agent alone, cotreatment with BA and ibrutinib markedly improved the median survival of mice engrafted with the MCL cells. BA treatment also induced apoptosis of the in vitro isolated, ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells, which overexpress CDK6, BCL2, Bcl-xL, XIAP, and AKT, but lack ibrutinib resistance-conferring BTK mutation. Cotreatment with BA and panobinostat (pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor) or palbociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) or ABT-199 (BCL2 antagonist) synergistically induced apoptosis of the ibrutinib-resistant MCL cells. These findings highlight and support further in vivo evaluation of the efficacy of the BA-based combinations with these agents against MCL, including ibrutinib-resistant MCL.},

We used a platform for drug discovery based on systems biology and artificial intelligence, to identify drugs targeting key proteins described to have a role in the microenvironment. The selected compounds were screened in CLL cell lines in the presence of stromal cells to mimic the microenvironment and validated the best candidates in primary CLL cells. Our results showed that the commercial drug simvastatin was the most effective and selective out of the tested compounds. Simvastatin decreased CLL cell survival and proliferation as well as cell adhesion. Importantly, this drug enhanced the antitumor effect of venetoclax and ibrutinib. We proposed that systems biology approaches combined with pharmacological screening could help to find new drugs for CLL treatment and to predict new combinations with current therapies.

abstract = {Tissue stromal cells interact with leukaemia cells and profoundly affect their viability and drug sensitivity. Here we show a biochemical mechanism by which bone marrow stromal cells modulate the redox status of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells and promote cellular survival and drug resistance. Primary CLL cells from patients exhibit a limited ability to transport cystine for glutathione (GSH) synthesis owing to a low expression level of Xc-transporter. In contrast, bone marrow stromal cells effectively import cystine and convert it to cysteine, which is then released into the microenvironment for uptake by CLL cells to promote GSH synthesis. The elevated level of GSH enhances leukaemia cell survival and protects them from drug-induced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, disabling this protective mechanism significantly sensitizes CLL cells to drug treatment in the stromal environment. This stromal-leukaemia interaction is critical for CLL cell survival and represents a key biochemical pathway for effectively targeting leukaemia cells to overcome drug resistance in vivo. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Purpose of Review: Over the last years, targeted anticancer therapy with small molecule inhibitors and antibodies has much replaced chemoimmunotherapy, which has been the gold standard of care for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Here we give an overview of novel targeted agents used in therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as efforts to overcome resistance development, focusing on approved drugs since they gained high relevance in clinical practice. Recent Findings: Novel agents moved to the forefront as a treatment strategy of CLL due to their outstanding efficacy, almost irrespectively of the underlying genetic features. Inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a key molecule in the B cell receptor pathway, achieved dramatic efficacy even in poor-risk and chemo-refractory patients. Further success was accomplished with venetoclax, which specifically inhibits anti-apoptotic BCL2 and induces apoptosis of CLL cells. Summary: Inhibition of BTK or BCL2 is very effective and induces prolongation of progression-free and overall survival. Approved combination treatments such as venetoclax or ibrutinib with obinutuzumab show high responses rates and long remission durations. However, evolution and selection of subclones with continuous treatment leads to resistance towards these novel drugs and disease relapse. Hence, comparison of sequential treatment with combinations and discontinuation of therapy are important aspects which need to be investigated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fluorescence in situ hybridization has improved the detection of genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We used this method to identify chromosomal abnormalities in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and assessed their prognostic implications. METHODS: Mononuclear cells from the blood of 325 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization for deletions in chromosome bands 6q21, 11q22-23, 13q14, and 17p13; trisomy of bands 3q26, 8q24, and 12q13; and translocations involving band 14q32. Molecular cytogenetic data were correlated with clinical findings. RESULTS: Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 268 of 325 cases (82 percent). The most frequent changes were a deletion in 13q (55 percent), a deletion in 11q (18 percent), trisomy of 12q (16 percent), a deletion in 17p (7 percent), and a deletion in 6q (7 percent). Five categories were defined with a statistical model: 17p deletion, 11q deletion, 12q trisomy, normal karyotype, and 13q deletion as the sole abnormality; the median survival times for patients in these groups were 32, 79, 114, 111, and 133 months, respectively. Patients in the 17p- and 11q-deletion groups had more advanced disease than those in the other three groups. Patients with 17p deletions had the shortest median treatment-free interval (9 months), and those with 13q deletions had the longest (92 months). In multivariate analysis, the presence or absence of a 17p deletion, the presence or absence of an 11q deletion, age, Binet stage, the serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and the white-cell count gave significant prognostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia are important independent predictors of disease progression and survival. These findings have implications for the design of risk-adapted treatment strategies.},

abstract = {Clinical endpoints are essential for assessing the safety and efficacy of new cancer therapies. They are used by oncologists to help guide clinical decision making. While overall survival (OS) has frequently been regarded as the "gold standard" primary clinical endpoint, it's utility is constrained by several disadvantages. The time-consuming nature of trials using OS has led to a recent push to explore surrogate clinical endpoints and their potential to serve as primary clinical endpoints in lieu of OS. Additionally, it is becoming evident that other endpoints add valuable information about quality of life and treatment failure as their use is becoming increasingly prevalent in oncology clinical trials. Without a doubt, the use of clinical endpoints will continue to expand and evolve as new cancer therapies are developed and novel treatments, including immunotherapy, draw interest. This review explores the roles of primary and surrogate clinical endpoints as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each specific endpoint. In addition, it directly compares the unique features of each suggesting some of the specific uses each one fulfills.},

abstract = {Background Deletion of chromosome 17p (del[17p]) in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia confers very poor prognosis when treated with standard chemo-immunotherapy. Venetoclax is an oral small-molecule BCL2 inhibitor that induces chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell apoptosis. In a previous first-in-human study of venetoclax, 77% of patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia achieved an overall response. Here we aimed to assess the activity and safety of venetoclax monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Methods In this phase 2, single-arm, multicentre study, we recruited patients aged 18 years and older with del(17p) relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (as defined by 2008 Modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia guidelines) from 31 centres in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Poland, and Australia. Patients started once daily venetoclax with a weekly dose ramp-up schedule (20, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg) over 4–5 weeks. Patients were then given daily 400 mg continuous dosing until disease progression or discontinuation for another reason. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an overall response, assessed by an independent review committee. Activity and safety analyses included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug (per protocol). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01889186. Follow-up is ongoing, and patients are still receiving treatment. Findings Between May 27, 2013, and June 27, 2014, 107 patients were enrolled into the study. At a median follow-up of 12{\textperiodcentered}1 months (IQR 10{\textperiodcentered}1–14{\textperiodcentered}2), an overall response by independent review was achieved in 85 (79{\textperiodcentered}4%; 95% CI 70{\textperiodcentered}5–86{\textperiodcentered}6) of 107 patients. The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were neutropenia (43 [40%]), infection (21 [20%]), anaemia (19 [18%]), and thrombocytopenia (16 [15%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 59 (55%) patients, irrespective of their relationship to treatment, with the most common (≥5% of patients) being pyrexia and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (seven [7%] each), pneumonia (six [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (five [5%]). 11 patients died in the study within 30 days of the last dose of venetoclax; seven due to disease progression and four from an adverse event (none assessed as treatment related). Interpretation Results of this trial show that venetoclax monotherapy is active and well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, providing a new therapeutic option for this very poor prognosis population. Additionally, in view of the distinct mechanism-of-action of venetoclax, combinations or sequencing with other novel targeted agents should be investigated to further advance treatment of del(17p) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is characterized by impaired immune functions largely due to profound T-cell defects. T-cell functions also depend on co-signaling receptors, inhibitory or stimulatory, known as immune checkpoints, including cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1). Here we analyzed the T-cell phenotype focusing on immune checkpoints and activation markers in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (n=80) with different clinical characteristics and compared them to healthy controls. In general, patients had higher absolute numbers of CD3+ cells and the CD8+ subset was particularly expanded in previously treated patients. Progressive patients had higher numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing PD-1 compared to healthy controls, which was more pronounced in previously treated patients (P=0.0003 and P=0.001, respectively). A significant increase in antigen-experienced T cells was observed in patients within both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets, with a significantly higher PD-1 expression. Higher numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells with intracellular CTLA-4 were observed in patients, as well as high numbers of proliferating (Ki67+) and activated (CD69+) CD4+ and CD8+ cells, more pronounced in patients with active disease. The numbers of Th1, Th2, Th17 and regulatory T cells were substantially increased in patients compared to controls (P},

abstract = {Humoral immunity requires B cells to respond to multiple stimuli, including antigen, membrane and soluble ligands, and microbial products. Ets family transcription factors regulate many aspects of haematopoiesis, although their functions in humoral immunity are difficult to decipher as a result of redundancy between the family members. Here we show that mice lacking both PU.1 and SpiB in mature B cells do not generate germinal centers and high-affinity antibody after protein immunization. PU.1 and SpiB double-deficient B cells have a survival defect after engagement of CD40 or Toll-like receptors (TLR), despite paradoxically enhanced plasma cell differentiation. PU.1 and SpiB regulate the expression of many components of the B cell receptor signaling pathway and the receptors for CD40L, BAFF and TLR ligands. Thus, PU.1 and SpiB enable B cells to appropriately respond to environmental cues. Although important for early development, PU.1 is dispensable for mature B cell function, possibly owing to compensation by the related transcription factor SpiB. Here the authors show PU.1 and SpiB are collectively required for humoral immunity, through regulation of germinal centre formation and plasma cell differentiation.},

abstract = {The Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) ibrutinib has transformed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) therapy but requires continuous administration. These factors have spurred interest in combination treatments. Unlike with chemotherapy, CD20-directed antibody therapy has not improved the outcome of BTKi treatment. Whereas CD20 antigen density on CLL cells decreases during ibrutinib treatment, the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and its receptor (BAFF-R) remain elevated. Furthermore, BAFF signaling via noncanonical NF-kB remains elevated with BTKi treatment. Blocking BAFF interaction with BAFF-R by using VAY-736, a humanized defucosylated engineered antibody directed against BAFF-R, antagonized BAFF-mediated apoptosis protection and signaling at the population and single-cell levels in CLL cells. Furthermore, VAY-736 showed superior antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity compared with CD20- and CD52-directed antibodies used in CLL. VAY-736 exhibited in vivo activity as a monotherapy and, when combined with ibrutinib, produced prolonged survival compared with either therapy alone. The in vivo activity of VAY-736 is dependent upon immunoreceptor tyrosine–based activation motif (ITAM)–mediated activation of effector cells as shown by using an ITAM-deficient mouse model. Collectively, our findings support targeting the BAFF signaling pathway with VAY-736 to more effectively treat CLL as a single agent and in combination with ibrutinib.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has heterogeneous clinical and biological behavior. Whole-genome and -exome sequencing has contributed to the characterization of the mutational spectrum of the disease, but the underlying transcriptional profile is still poorly understood. We have performed deep RNA sequencing in different subpopulations of normal B-lymphocytes and CLL cells from a cohort of 98 patients, and characterized the CLL transcriptional landscape with unprecedented resolution. We detected thousands of transcriptional elements differentially expressed between the CLL and normal B cells, including protein-coding genes, noncoding RNAs, and pseudogenes. Transposable elements are globally derepressed in CLL cells. In addition, two thousand genes-most of which are not differentially expressed-exhibit CLL-specific splicing patterns. Genes involved in metabolic pathways showed higher expression in CLL, while genes related to spliceosome, proteasome, and ribosome were among the most down-regulated in CLL. Clustering of the CLL samples according to RNA-seq derived gene expression levels unveiled two robust molecular subgroups, C1 and C2. C1/C2 subgroups and the mutational status of the immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV ) region were the only independent variables in predicting time to treatment in a multivariate analysis with main clinico-biological features. This subdivision was validated in an independent cohort of patients monitored through DNA microarrays. Further analysis shows that B-cell receptor (BCR) activation in the microenvironment of the lymph node may be at the origin of the C1/C2 differences. {\textcopyright} 2014 Hansen et al.},

We analyzed whether mutation of TP53 on the remaining allele adds to the poor prognosis or whether even TP53 mutation alone may be an adverse prognostic factor. We analyzed TP53 mutations in 193 CLL patients by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography in combination with direct DNA sequencing and a TP53 resequencing research microarray. Mutations were correlated to chromosomal aberrations defined by interphase fluorescent in situ hybridization and chromosome banding analyses and to the clinical course of patients. TP53 mutations were detected in 13.5% (26 of 193) of samples, whereas the incidence of del (17p) was 9.3% (18 of 193). TP53 mutations were significantly associated with del (17p) (concordance 94%, P<0.001) and complex cytogenetic abnormalities (concordance 50%, P<0.001). Among 147 patients whose clinical data were available, patients with TP53 abnormalities (n=20) had a significantly decreased time to treatment compared to patients without TP53 aberration (P<0.001). Median time to treatment was short in patients with isolated TP53 mutation (n=6, 2.0 months) and in those with del (17p) (n=14, 21.3 months) as compared to patients without TP53 aberration (n=127, 64.9 months, P<0.001).

abstract = {Clinical responses to anticancer therapies are often restricted to a subset of patients. In some cases, mutated cancer genes are potent biomarkers for responses to targeted agents. Here, to uncover new biomarkers of sensitivity and resistance to cancer therapeutics, we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell lines-which represent much of the tissue-type and genetic diversity of human cancers-with 130 drugs under clinical and preclinical investigation. In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Although there has been considerable progress in reducing cancer incidence in the United States, the number of cancer survivors continues to increase due to the aging and growth of the population and improvements in survival rates. As a result, it is increasingly important to understand the unique medical and psychosocial needs of survivors and be aware of resources that can assist patients, caregivers, and health care providers in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship. To highlight the challenges and opportunities to serve these survivors, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute estimated the prevalence of cancer survivors on January 1, 2012 and January 1, 2022, by cancer site. Data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries were used to describe median age and stage at diagnosis and survival; data from the National Cancer Data Base and the SEER-Medicare Database were used to describe patterns of cancer treatment. An estimated 13.7 million Americans with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2012, and by January 1, 2022, that number will increase to nearly 18 million. The 3 most prevalent cancers among males are prostate (43%), colorectal (9%), and melanoma of the skin (7%), and those among females are breast (41%), uterine corpus (8%), and colorectal (8%).

abstract = {Deletions of the 13q14 chromosome region are associated with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and several other types of cancer, suggesting the presence of a tumor suppressor gene. In previous studies the minimal region of deletion (MDR) was mapped to a less than 300-kilobase (kb) interval bordered by the markers 173a12-82 and 138G4/1.3R. For the identification of the putative tumor suppressor gene, the entire MDR (approximately 347 kb) has been sequenced, and transcribed regions have been identified by exon trapping, EST-based full-length complementary DNA cloning, database homology searches, and computer-assisted gene prediction analyses. The MDR contains 2 pseudogenes and 3 transcribed genes: CAR, encoding a putative RING-finger containing protein; 1B4/Leu2, generating noncoding transcripts; and EST70/Leul, probably representing another noncoding gene (longest open reading frame of 78 codons). These genes have been sequenced in 20 B-CLL cases with 13q14 hemizygous deletion, and no mutations were found. Moreover, no somatic variants were found in the entire MDR analyzed for nucleotide substitutions by a combination of direct sequencing and fluorescence-assisted mismatch analysis in 5 B-CLL cases displaying 13q14-monoallelic deletion. The nondeleted allele of the CAR and EST70/Leu1 genes was expressed in B-CLL specimens, including those with monoallelic loss, whereas no expression of 1B4/Leu2 was detectable in B-CLL, regardless of the 13q14 status. These results indicate that allelic loss and mutation of a gene within the MDR is an unlikely pathogenetic mechanism for B-CLL. However, haplo-insufficiency of one of the identified genes may contribute to tumorigenesis. {\textcopyright} 2001 by The American Society of Hematology.},

abstract = {During fetal development, murine and human B-lineage cells rearrange and express a highly restricted set of immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (V(H) genes). We noted that a V(H) gene of the restricted human fetal repertoire, designated 51p1, potentially could encode the V(H) region of two human IgM rheumatoid factor proteins. These rheumatoid factors share a cross-reactive idiotype (CRI) defined by reactivity with G6, a murine monoclonal antibody that recognizes an antibody heavy chain determinant present on many human IgM autoantibodies, particularly rheumatoid factors. Recently, we found that the G6 CRI also is expressed frequently by neoplastic CD5 (Leu1) B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma. However, neoplastic CD5-negative B cells from patients with lymphomas of follicular center cell origin rarely express this CRI. Here, we report that G6-reactive leukemic cells from two unrelated CLL patients express a V(H) gene that shares > 99% homology with a rearranged V(H) gene previously isolated from the leukemic cell DNA of another CLL patient and that is identical to V(H) 51p1. Using the polymerase chain reaction, we find that this V(H) gene is rearranged, and presumably expressed, in the genomic DNA of all examined cases of G6-reactive CLL or small lymphocytic lymphoma. Thus these data indicate that the autoantibody-associated G6 CRI is a serologic marker for a conserved and developmentally restricted V(H)1 gene that is expressed at high frequency in CD5 B-cell malignancies and early B-cell ontogeny.},

abstract = {PU.1 is an E26 transformation-specific family transcription factor that is required for development of the immune system. PU.1 functions at both early and late stages of lymphoid and myeloid differentiation. At least 110 direct target genes of PU.1 have been identified since its discovery in 1988. We used the published literature to determine if aspects of PU.1 function can be inferred from the identity of target genes that are directly activated. This analysis revealed that 61% of described PU.1 target genes encode extracellular proteins or transmembrane proteins, most of which are involved in cellular communication. The genes activated by PU.1 can be grouped into pathways based on function. Specific examples of cellular communication pathways regulated by PU.1 include (1) antibodies and antibody receptors, (2) cytokines and cytokine receptors regulating leukocyte growth and development, and (3) cytokines and cytokine receptors regulating inflammation. As a consequence of mutation or repression of the gene encoding PU.1, hematopoietic progenitors may be generated but there is a "failure to thrive" because they cannot interact with their environment. The loss of cellular communication caused by reduced PU.1 levels can lead to leukemia. In summary, PU.1 is a critical regulator of cellular communication in the immune system. {\textcopyright} 2011 L. Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Wroclaw, Poland.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is caused by the progressive accumulation of mature CD5+ B cells in secondary lymphoid organs. In vitro data suggest that CD4+ T lymphocytes also sustain survival and proliferation of CLL clones through CD40L/CD40 interactions. In vivo data in animal models are conflicting. To clarify this clinically relevant biological issue, we generated genetically modified E$\mu$-TCL1 mice lacking CD4+ T cells (TCL1+/+AB0), CD40 (TCL1+/+CD40−/−), or CD8+ T cells (TCL1+/+TAP−/−), and we monitored the appearance and progression of a disease that mimics aggressive human CLL by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses. Findings were confirmed by adoptive transfer of leukemic cells into mice lacking CD4+ T cells or CD40L or mice treated with antibodies depleting CD4 T cells or blocking CD40L/CD40 interactions. CLL clones did not proliferate in mice lacking or depleted of CD4+ T cells, thus confirming that CD4+ T cells are essential for CLL development. By contrast, CD8+ T cells exerted an antitumor activity, as indicated by the accelerated disease progression in TCL1+/+TAP−/− mice. Antigen specificity of CD4+ T cells was marginal for CLL development, because CLL clones efficiently proliferated in transgenic mice whose CD4 T cells had a T-cell receptor with CLL-unrelated specificities. Leukemic clones also proliferated when transferred into wild-type mice treated with monoclonal antibodies blocking CD40 or into CD40L−/− mice, and TCL1+/+CD40−/− mice developed frank CLL. Our data demonstrate that CD8+ T cells restrain CLL progression, whereas CD4+ T cells support the growth of leukemic clones in TCL1 mice through CD40-independent and apparently noncognate mechanisms.},

abstract = {The chemokine CXCL12, via its receptor CXCR4, promotes increased survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells that express high levels of-chain-associated protein (ZAP-70), a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with aggressive disease. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this effect. Although significant differences in the expression or turnover of CXCR4 were not observed between ZAP-70 and ZAP-70 cell samples, CXCL12 induced greater intra-cellular Ca 2 flux and stronger and more prolonged phosphorylation of extracellu-lar signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mi-togen-activated protein kinase/ERK ki-nase (MEK) in the ZAP-70 CLL cells. The CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of ERK and MEK in ZAP-70 CLL cells was blocked by sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of RAF. Furthermore, ZAP-70 CLL cells were more sensitive than ZAP-70 CLL cells to the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in vitro at concentrations that can readily be achieved in vivo. The data suggest that ZAP-70 CLL cells may be more responsive to survival factors, like CXCL12, that are elaborated by the leuke-mia microenvironment, and this sensitivity could be exploited for the development of new treatments for patients with this disease. Moreover, sorafenib may have clinical activity for patients with CLL, particularly those with ZAP-70 CLL. (Blood. 2011;117(3):882-889)},

abstract = {In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the non-hematopoietic stromal microenvironment plays a critical role in promoting tumor cell recruitment, activation, survival, and expansion. However, the nature of the stromal cells and molecular pathways involved remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that leukemic B lymphocytes induce the activation of retinoid acid synthesis and signaling in the microenvironment. Inhibition of RA-signaling in stromal cells causes deregulation of genes associated with adhesion, tissue organization and chemokine secretion including the B-cell chemokine CXCL13. Notably, reducing retinoic acid precursors from the diet or inhibiting RA-signaling through retinoid-antagonist therapy prolong survival by preventing dissemination of leukemia cells into lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, mouse and human leukemia cells could be distinguished from normal B-cells by their increased expression of Rar$\gamma$2 and RXR$\alpha$, respectively. These findings establish a role for retinoids in murine CLL pathogenesis, and provide new therapeutic strategies to target the microenvironment and to control disease progression.},

Multi-omics data integration strategies across different cellular function levels, including genomes, epigenomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes, and microbiomes offer unparalleled opportunities to understand the underlying biology of complex diseases, such as cancer. We review some of the most frequently used data integration methods and outline research areas where multi-omics significantly benefit our understanding of the process and outcome of the malignant transformation. We discuss algorithmic frameworks developed to reveal cancer subtypes, disease mechanisms, and methods for identifying driver genomic alterations and consider the significance of multi-omics in tumor classifications, diagnostics, and prognostications. We provide a comprehensive summary of each omics strategy's most recent advances within the clinical context and discuss the main challenges facing their clinical implementations. Despite its unparalleled advantages, multi-omics data integration is slow to enter everyday clinics. One major obstacle is the uneven maturity of different omics approaches and the growing gap between generating large volumes of data compared to data processing capacity. Progressive initiatives to enforce the standardization of sample processing and analytical pipelines, multidisciplinary training of experts for data analysis and interpretation are vital to facilitate the translatability of theoretical findings.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: Based on the methylation status of 5 single CpG sites, a novel epigenetic classification of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was recently proposed, classifying CLL patients into 3 clinico-biological subgroups with different outcome, termed memory like CLL (m-CLL), na{\"{i}}ve like CLL (n-CLL), and a third intermediate CLL subgroup (i-CLL). While m-CLL and n-CLL patients at large corresponded to patients carrying mutated and unmutated IGHV genes, respectively, limited information exists regarding the less defined i-CLL group. Using pyrosequencing, we investigated the prognostic impact of the proposed 5 CpG signature in a well-characterized CLL cohort (135 cases), including IGHV-mutated and unmutated patients as well as clinically aggressive stereotyped subset #2 patients. Overall, we confirmed the signature's association with established prognostic markers. Moreover, in the presence of the IGHV mutational status, the epigenetic signature remained independently associated with both time-to-first-treatment and overall survival in multivariate analyses. As a prime finding, we observed that subset #2 patients were predominantly classified as i-CLL, probably reflecting their borderline IGHV mutational status (97–99% germline identity), though having a similarly poor prognosis as n-CLL patients. In summary, we validated the epigenetic classifier as an independent factor in CLL prognostication and provide further evidence that subset #2 is a member of the i-CLL group, hence supporting the existence of a third, intermediate epigenetic subgroup.},

abstract = {Purpose: Del17p13 predicts poor outcome and chemorefractoriness in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Conversely, it is unknown whether TP53 mutations carry any prognostic value independent of del17p13. We tested the independent prognostic value of TP53 mutations in CLL. Experimental Design: The study was based on a consecutive series of 308 CLL. DNA sequencing of TP53 exons 2 to 10 and del 17p13 interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization were done at CLL diagnosis. Study end points were survival and chemorefractoriness. Results: At diagnosis, TP53 mutations (n = 32) occurred in 31 of 308 (10.0%) patients. Of all CLL showing TP53 disruption by either mutation and/or deletion (n = 44), 10 cases (22.7%) showed TP53 mutations in the absence of del17p13. Multivariate analysis selected TP53 mutations (hazard ratio, 3.20; P = 0.002) as an independent predictor of overall survival after adjustment for del17p13. Also, multivariate analysis selected TP53 mutations (hazard ratio, 3.97; P < 0.001) as an independent predictor of chemorefractoriness after adjustment for del17p13. Compared with cases without TP53 alterations, CLL harboring any type of TP53 disruption (mutation only, del17p13 only, or both mutation and del17p13) uniformly displayed a high prevalence of unfavorable prognosticators and poor outcome. Analysis of sequential CLL samples showed the acquisition of new or additional TP53 alterations at the time of chemorefractoriness. Conclusions: These data show that (a) TP53 mutations are an independent predictor of short survival and chemorefractoriness, and (b) that CLL presenting with TP53 mutations without del17p13 fare as poorly as CLL carrying del17p13. Because CLL harboring TP53 mutations without del17p13 are currently not recognized by conventional diagnostic strategies, these results may be relevant for a comprehensive prognostic characterization of CLL. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.},

We extend the number of CLL driver alterations, including changes in ZNF292, ZMYM3, ARID1A and PTPN11. We also identify novel recurrent mutations in non-coding regions, including the 3′ region of NOTCH1, which cause aberrant splicing events, increase NOTCH1 activity and result in a more aggressive disease. In addition, mutations in an enhancer located on chromosome 9p13 result in reduced expression of the B-cell-specific transcription factor PAX5.

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of long-lived non-dividing CD5+ B cells. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important regulator of apoptosis, and the viability of cultured B-CLL cells may be dependent on the autocrine production of nitric oxide by inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2). We performed this study to determine whether cytokine factors that prevent spontaneous in vitro apoptosis of B-CLL cells induce B-CLL cell NOS2 enzyme activity. B-CLL cells expressed NOS enzyme activity and NOS2 protein and mRNA. IL-4 and IFN-$\gamma$ increased B-CLL cell NOS2 enzyme activity and protein expression during in vitro culture. IFN-$\gamma$, but not IL-4, increased NOS2 mRNA expression in cultured B-CLL cells suggesting that IL-4-mediated changes of NOS2 protein expression occurred at the post-transcriptional level. We were unable to detect increased concentrations of nitrite or nitrate (NOx) as surrogate markers of NO production in B-CLL cell cultures treated with IL-4 or IFN-$\gamma$. IL-4 and IFN-$\gamma$ diminished NOS inhibitor-induced B-CLL cell death. In summary, we found that B-CLL cells expressed NOS2 and that IL-4 and IFN-$\gamma$ increased B-CLL NOS2 expression. Cytokine-mediated expression of NOS2 by B-CLL cells may promote their survival, and therapeutic strategies that target NOS2 or quench NO may be beneficial in patients with B-CLL.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Chemokines play a central role for lymphocyte trafficking and homing. The mechanisms that direct the tissue localization of B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) are unknown. We found that CLL B cells express functional CXCR4 receptors for the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), as demonstrated by receptor endocytosis, calcium mobilization, and actin polymerization assays. Moreover, CLL B cells displayed chemotaxis to this chemokine that could be inhibited by monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against CXCR4, pertussis toxin, or Wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor. That this chemotaxis may be involved in the homing of CLL cells is argued by studies in which CLL B cells were cocultured with a murine marrow stromal cell line that secretes SDF-1. Within 2 hours, CLL B cells spontaneously migrated beneath such stromal cells in vitro (pseudoemperipolesis). This migration could be inhibited by pretreatment of CLL B cells with anti-CXCR4 MoAbs, SDF-1$\alpha$, or pertussis-toxin. Furthermore, we noted strong downmodulation of CXCR4 on CLL B cells that migrated into the stromal cell layer. These findings demonstrate that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on CLL B cells plays a critical role for heterotypic adherence to marrow stromal cells and provide a new mechanism to account for the marrow infiltration by neoplastic B cells.},

abstract = {The majority of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) are not cured by traditional chemotherapy. One possible explanation for this is that the microenvironment protects CLL cells from both spontaneous-and cytotoxic-mediated apoptosis. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms accounting for these effects, since this information is crucial to understanding CLL physiopathology and identifying potential treatment targets. The CLL cell line L1210 and primary CLL cells were cultured under different conditions: With serum, cyclophosphamide (CTX), or with monolayers and conditioned medium (CM) from the stromal cell line HESS-5. Apoptosis, Hes family BHLH transcription factor 1 (HES-1) gene and protein expression, and histone H3K27me3 DNA demethylation were determined. Co-culture of L1210 cells with HESS-5 cells significantly inhibited serum deprivation-and CTX-induced apoptosis of leukemia cells, and resulted in a significant increase in short-term proliferation. Soluble factors in the CM from HESS-5 cells had a negligible effect. The HESS-5 cell-mediated inhibition of apoptosis of CLL cells was associated with increased HES-1 expression and hypomethylation of the H3K27me3 gene in the leukemia cells. These results indicate that stromal cells enhance the survival of CLL cells by regulating the HES-1 gene and protein expression, as well as H3K27me3 DNA demethylation, and suggest that specific interactions between stromal and leukemia cells may enhance the resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Despite significant progress in treatment, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) remains an incurable disease. Advances have been made to understand the molecular pathogenesis underlying CLL progression and treatment resistance. We here review the available evidences concerning the role of the B-cell receptor (BCR) and the tumor microenvironment interactions in CLL pathogenesis. Antigen likely has a key role in the selection of the tumoral clone, the mutational status of immunoglobulin genes is a strong prognostic predictor and BCR signaling has been postulated to have a role for CLL trafficking and interaction with the stromal microenvironment. There is also important evidence, favoring a role for the microenvironment in CLL pathogenesis. Most, if not all, proliferative events occur in the lymph nodes and bone marrow, where leukemic cells receive through microenvironment interactions survival signals aiming to avoid apoptosis and acquire favorable tumoral growing conditions. In addition, the tumoral microenvironment appears to be the site where the acquisition of additional genetic lesions in the clone occur, which should greatly influence clinical outcome. The advent of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors which seem to be able to modulate microenvironment interactions and circumvent the p53 deletion have generated significant promise by raising the possibility that they could provide significant progress in disease treatment.},

However, in addition to the benefits generated by its physiological roles, AID is an etiological factor for the development of human and murine leukemias and lymphomas. This review highlights the pathological role of AID and the consequences of its actions on the development, progression, and therapeutic refractoriness of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a model disease for mature lymphoid malignancies. First, we summarize pertinent aspects of the expression and function of AID in normal B lymphocytes. Then, we assess putative causes for AID expression in leukemic cells emphasizing the role of an activated microenvironment. Thirdly, we discuss the role of AID in lymphomagenesis, in light of recent data obtained by NGS analyses on the genomic landscape of leukemia and lymphomas, concentrating on the frequency of AID signatures in these cancers and correlating previously described tumor-gene drivers with the presence of AID off-target mutations. Finally, we discuss how these changes could affect tumor suppressor and proto-oncogene targets and how they could be associated with disease progression. Collectively, we hope that these sections will help to better understand the complex paradox between the physiological role of AID in adaptive immunity and its potential causative activity in B-cell malignancies.},

abstract = {ABT-737 and its orally active analog, ABT-263, are rationally designed inhibitors of BCL2 and BCL-XL. ABT-263 shows promising activity in early phase 1 clinical trials in B-cell malignancies, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In vitro, peripheral blood CLL cells are extremely sensitive to ABT-737 (EC50 ∼7 nM), with rapid induction of apoptosis in all 60 patients tested, independent of parameters associated with disease progression and chemotherapy resistance. In contrast to data from cell lines, ABT-737-induced apoptosis in CLL cells was largely MCL1-independent. Because CLL cells within lymph nodes are more resistant to apoptosis than those in peripheral blood, CLL cells were cultured on CD154-expressing fibroblasts in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) to mimic the lymph node microenvironment. CLL cells thus cultured developed an approximately 1000-fold resistance to ABT-737 within 24 hours. Investigations of the underlying mechanism revealed that this resistance occurred upstream of mitochondrial perturbation and involved de novo synthesis of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-XL and BCL2A1, which were responsible for resistance to low and high ABT-737 concentrations, respectively. Our data indicate that after therapy with ABT-737-related inhibitors, resistant CLL cells might develop in lymph nodes in vivo and that treatment strategies targeting multiple BCL2 antiapoptotic members simultaneously may have synergistic activity. {\textcopyright} 2009 by The American Society of Hematology.},

However, several issues need revisiting, including the criteria for identification of BCR stereotypy and its actual frequency as well as the identification of "CLL-biased" features in BCR Ig stereotypes. To this end, we examined 7596 Ig VH (IGHV-IGHD-IGHJ) sequences from 7424 CLL patients, 3 times the size of the largest published series, with an updated version of our purpose-built clustering algorithm. We document that CLL may be subdivided into 2 distinct categories: one with stereotyped and the other with nonstereotyped BCRs, at an approximate ratio of 1:2, and provide evidence suggesting a different ontogeny for these 2 categories. We also show that subset-defining sequence patterns in CLL differ from those underlying BCR stereotypy in other B-cell malignancies. Notably, 19 major subsets contained from 20 to 213 sequences each, collectively accounting for 943 sequences or one-eighth of the cohort. Hence, this compartmentalized examination ofVHsequencesmaypave the way toward a molecular classification of CLL with implications for targeted therapeutic interventions, applicable to a significant number of patients assigned to the same subset. {\textcopyright} 2012 by The American Society of Hematology.},

However, the massive data sets generated by NGS - the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases - make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the Western world. Survival of CLL cells depends on their close contact with stromal cells in lymphatic tissues, bone marrow and blood. This microenvironmental regulation of CLL cell survival involves the stromal secretion of chemo- and cytokines as well as the expression of adhesion molecules. Since CLL survival may also be driven by antigenic stimulation through the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR), we explored the hypothesis that these processes may be linked to each other. We tested if stromal cells could serve as an antigen reservoir for CLL cells, thus promoting CLL cell survival by stimulation through the BCR. As a proof of principle, we found that two CLL BCRs with a common stereotyped heavy chain complementarity-determining region 3 (previously characterized as “subset 1”) recognize antigens highly expressed in stromal cells – vimentin and calreticulin. Both antigens are well-documented targets of autoantibodies in autoimmune disorders. We demonstrated that vimentin is displayed on the surface of viable stromal cells and that it is present and bound by the stereotyped CLL BCR in CLL-stroma co-culture supernatant. Blocking the vimentin antigen by recombinant soluble CLL BCR under CLL-stromal cell co-culture conditions reduces stroma-mediated anti-apoptotic effects by 20–45%. We therefore conclude that CLL BCR stimulation by stroma-derived antigens can contribute to the protective effect that the stroma exerts on CLL cells. This finding sheds a new light on the understanding of the pathobiology of this so far mostly incurable disease.},

abstract = {The malignant, CD5+ B lymphocytes of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) die by apoptosis in vitro. This is in contrast to the prolonged life span of the leukemic cells in vivo and likely reflects the lack of essential growth factors in the tissue culture medium. We found that interferon $\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$) inhibits programmed cell death and promotes survival of B-CLL cells in culture. This effect may also be important in vivo: increased serum levels of IFN-$\gamma$ ranging from 60 to >2,200 pg/ml, were found in 7 of 10 B-CLL samples tested, whereas the sera of 10 healthy individuals did not contain detectable levels of this cytokine (<20 pg/ml). High levels of IFN-$\gamma$ message were detected in RNA from T cell-depleted B-CLL peripheral blood samples by Northern blot analysis. Synthesis of IFN-$\gamma$ by B-CLL lymphocytes was confirmed by in situ hybridization and flow cytometry. The majority of B-CLL cells (74-82%) expressed detectable levels of IFN-$\gamma$ mRNA, and CD19+ B-CLL cells were labeled with anti-IFN-$\gamma$, monoclonal antibodies. These results show that IFN-$\gamma$ inhibits programmed cell death in B-CLL cells and suggest that the malignant cells are able to synthesize this cytokine. By delaying apoptosis, IFN-$\gamma$ may extend the life span of the malignant cells and thereby contribute to their clonal accumulation. {\textcopyright} Rockefeller University Press.},

We exploited a novel functional assay that uses BCL2 homology domain 3 (BH3) peptides to predict dependence on antiapoptotic proteins, a strategy we call BH3 profiling. BH3 profiling accurately predicts sensitivity to BCL2 antagonist ABT-737 in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. BH3 profiling also accurately distinguishes myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) from BCL2 dependence in myeloma cell lines. We show that the special sensitivity of CLL cells to BCL2 antagonism arises from the requirement that BCL2 tonically sequester proapoptotic BIM in CLL. ABT-737 displaced BIM from BCL2's BH3-binding pocket, allowing BIM to activate BAX, induce mitochondrial permeabilization, and rapidly commit the CLL cell to death. Our experiments demonstrate that BCL2 expression alone does not dictate sensitivity to ABT-737. Instead, BCL2 complexed to BIM is the critical target for ABT-737 in CLL. An important implication is that in cancer, BCL2 may not effectively buffer chemotherapy death signals if it is already sequestering proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. Indeed, activator BH3-only occupation of BCL2 may prime cancer cells for death, offering a potential explanation for the marked chemosensitivity of certain cancers that express abundant BCL2, such as CLL and follicular lymphoma.},

abstract = {Ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) has generated remarkable responses in CLL. However, the drug, to a large extent, does not cause cell death directly and does not eradicate CLL malignant clones. Inability to eradicate CLL has fostered resistance generation. Once patients become resistant, they do poorly with a median survival of 3-4 months. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to prevent resistance, improve treatment outcome and ultimately cure the disease. Herein, we explore dual targeting of the BCR and JAK-STAT pathways with a novel single agent, cerdulatinib, which selectively inhibits both SYK (a BCR component) and JAK kinases. We demonstrated that cerdulatinib delivered potent tumor inhibition in 60 primary CLL patient samples, especially in those with poor prognostic indicators. Importantly, cerdulatinib, but not ibrutinib, is able to overcome the support of microenvironment and induces CLL cell death at clinically achievable concentrations. Notably, cerdulatinib blocked proliferation of ibrutinib-resistant primary CLL cells and of BTKC481S-transfected/ibrutinib-resistant lymphoma cells. These anti-tumor effects are well correlated with the inhibition of BCR and JAK-STAT signaling and downstream inhibition of the functions of AKT, ERK and NF$\kappa$B. Collectively, our results show that simultaneous targeting of BCR and JAK-STAT pathways is a more effective strategy relative to single BTK inhibition.},

abstract = {B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is aberrantly activated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) is essential to BCR signaling and in knockout mouse models its mutation has a relatively B cell-specific phenotype. Herein, we demonstrate that BTK protein and mRNA are significantly over expressed in CLL compared with normal B cells. Although BTK is not always constitutively active in CLL cells, BCR or CD40 signaling is accompanied by effective activation of this pathway. Using the irreversible BTK inhibitor PCI-32765, we demonstrate modest apoptosis in CLL cells that is greater than that observed in normal B cells. No influence of PCI-32765 on T-cell survival is observed. Treatment of CD40 or BCR activated CLL cells with PCI-32765 results in inhibition of BTK tyrosine phosphorylation and also effectively abrogates downstream survival pathways activated by this kinase including ERK1/2, PI3K, and NF-kB. In addition, PCI-32765 inhibits activation-induced proliferation of CLL cells in vitro, and effectively blocks survival signals provided externally to CLL cells from the microenvironment including soluble factors (CD40L, BAFF, IL-6, IL-4, and TNF-$\alpha$), fibronectin engagement, and stromal cell contact. Based on these collective data, future efforts targeting BTK with the irreversible inhibitor PCI-32765 in clinical trials of CLL patients is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The American Society of Hematology.},

We studied intratumoral heterogeneity in 149 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases by integrating whole-exome sequence and copy number to measure the fraction of cancer cells harboring each somatic mutation. We identified driver mutations as predominantly clonal (e.g., MYD88, trisomy 12, and del(13q)) or subclonal (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53), corresponding to earlier and later events in CLL evolution. We sampled leukemia cells from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution, predominantly involving subclones with driver mutations (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid disease progression. Our study thus uncovers patterns of clonal evolution in CLL, providing insights into its stepwise transformation, and links the presence of subclones with adverse clinical outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Despite new targeted therapies such as ibrutinib and venetoclax, disease progression and relapse remain an issue. CLL cell interactions with the supportive tissue microenvironment play a critical role in disease pathogenesis. We used a platform for drug discovery based on systems biology and artificial intelligence, to identify drugs targeting key proteins described to have a role in the microenvironment. The selected compounds were screened in CLL cell lines in the presence of stromal cells to mimic the microenvironment and validated the best candidates in primary CLL cells. Our results showed that the commercial drug simvastatin was the most effective and selective out of the tested compounds. Simvastatin decreased CLL cell survival and proliferation as well as cell adhesion. Importantly, this drug enhanced the antitumor effect of venetoclax and ibrutinib. We proposed that systems biology approaches combined with pharmacological screening could help to find new drugs for CLL treatment and to predict new combinations with current therapies. Our results highlight the possibility of repurposing widely used drugs such as statins to target the microenvironment and to improve the efficacy of ibrutinib or venetoclax in CLL cells.},

abstract = {CXCL13 is a homeostatic chemokine for lymphocyte homing and positioning within follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues, acting through its cognate receptor, CXCR5. Moreover, the CXCR5-CXCL13 axis plays a unique role in trafficking and homing of B1 cells. Here, we report that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells express high levels of functional CXCR5. CXCR5 expression levels were similar on CLL B cells and normal CD5+ B cells, and higher compared with normal CD5− B cells, follicular B-helper T cells (TFH cells), or neoplastic B cells from other B-cell neoplasias. Stimulation of CLL cells with CXCL13 induces actin polymerization, CXCR5 endocytosis, chemotaxis, and prolonged activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Anti-CXCR5 antibodies, pertussis toxin, and wortmannin inhibited chemotaxis to CXCL13, demonstrating the importance of Gi proteins and PI3 kinases for CXCR5 signaling. Moreover, CLL patients had significantly higher CXCL13 serum levels than volunteers, and CXCL13 levels correlated with $\beta$2 microglobulin. We detected CXCL13 mRNA expression by nurselike cells, and high levels of CXCL13 protein in supernatants of CLL nurselike cell cultures. By immunohistochemistry, we detected CXCL13+ expression by CD68+ macrophages in situ within CLL lymph nodes. These data suggest that CXCR5 plays a role in CLL cell positioning and cognate interactions between CLL and CXCL13-secreting CD68+ accessory cells in lymphoid tissues.},

CLL is an incurable disease with a heterogeneous clinical course, for which the treatment decision still relies on conventional parameters (such as clinical stage and lymphocyte doubling time). During the past 5 years, relevant advances have been made in understanding CLL biology. Indeed, substantial progress has been made in the identification of the putative cell of origin of CLL, and comprehensive studies have dissected the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of CLL. Advances in clinical management include improvements in our understanding of the prognostic value of different genetic lesions, particularly those associated with chemoresistance and progression to highly aggressive forms of CLL, and the advent of new therapies targeting crucial biological pathways. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of CLL and how these genetic insights influence clinical management and the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease. In this Review, the authors present current insights into the genetic aetiology and pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, highlighting the effect of recurrent lesions on progression, and discuss their clinical implications for management and development of novel therapeutic paradigmns.},

@article{OHayre2010,
abstract = {Background: Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) pathogenesis has been linked to the prolonged survival and/orapoptotic resistance of leukemic B cells in vivo, and is thought to be due to enhanced survival signaling responses to environmental factors that protect CLL cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced death. Although normally associated with cell migration, the chemokine, CXCL12, is one of the factors known to support the survival of CLL cells. Thus, the signaling pathways activated by CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, were nvestigated as components of these pathways and may represent targets that if inhibited, could render resistant CLL cells more susceptible to chemotherapy. Methodology/Principal Findings: To determine the downstream signaling targets that contribute to the survival effects of CXCL12 in CLL, we took a phosphoproteomics approach to identify and compare phosphopeptides in unstimulated and CXCL12-stimulated primary CLL cells. While some of the survival pathways activated by CXCL12 in CLL are known, including Akt and ERK1/2, this approach enabled the identification of additional signaling targets and novel phosphoproteins that could have implications in CLL disease and therapy. In addition to the phosphoproteomics results, we provide evidence from western blot validation that the tumor suppressor, programmed cell death factor 4 (PDCD4), is a previously unidentified phosphorylation target of CXCL12 signaling in all CLL cells probed. Additionally, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), which mediates anti-apoptotic signaling and has previously been linked to chemotherapeutic resistance, was detected in a subset (,25%) of CLL patients cells examined. Conclusions/Significance: Since PDCD4 and HSP27 have previously been associated with cancer and regulation of cell growth and apoptosis, these proteins may have novel implications in CLL cell survival and represent potential herapeutic targets. PDCD4 also represents a previously unknown signaling target of chemokine receptors; therefore, these observations increase our understanding of alternative pathways to migration that may be activated or inhibited by chemokines in the context of cancer cell survival. {\textcopyright} 2010 O'Hayre et al.},

This co-culture system induced proliferation and chemoresistance in primary CLL cells. Importantly, co-cultured primary CLL cells shared many phenotypical features with circulating proliferative CLL cells, such as upregulation of ZAP-70 and CD38 and higher CD49d and CD62L expression. This indicates aggressiveness and capability to interact with surrounding cells, respectively. In addition, levels of CXCR4 were decreased due to CXCR4 internalization after CXCL12 stimulation by BM stromal cells.

To improve current approaches to combination treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and gain insights into the underlying biology, we studied the effect of 352 drug combination pairs in multiple concentrations by analysing ex vivo drug response of 52 primary CLL samples, which were characterized by “omics” profiling. Known synergistic interactions were confirmed for B-cell receptor (BCR) inhibitors with Bcl-2 inhibitors and with chemotherapeutic drugs, suggesting that this approach can identify clinically useful combinations. Moreover, we uncovered synergistic interactions between BCR inhibitors and afatinib, which we attribute to BCR activation by afatinib through BLK upstream of BTK and PI3K. Combinations of multiple inhibitors of BCR components (e.g., BTK, PI3K, SYK) had effects similar to the single agents. While PI3K and BTK inhibitors produced overall similar effects in combinations with other drugs, we uncovered a larger response heterogeneity of combinations including PI3K inhibitors, predominantly in CLL with mutated IGHV, which we attribute to the target's position within the BCR-signaling pathway. Taken together, our study shows that drug combination effects can be effectively queried in primary cancer cells, which could aid discovery, triage and clinical development of drug combinations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who are elderly or who have comorbidities is challenging because fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapies are mostly not suitable. Chlorambucil remains the standard of care in many countries. We aimed to investigate whether the addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil could lead to better clinical outcomes than does treatment with chlorambucil alone, while also being tolerable for patients who have few treatment options. METHODS We carried out a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial for treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 109 centres in 16 countries. We included patients who had active disease needing treatment, but in whom fludarabine-based treatment was not possible. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive oral chlorambucil (10 mg/m(2)) on days 1-7 of a 28 day treatment course or to receive chlorambucil by this schedule plus intravenous ofatumumab (cycle 1: 300 mg on day 1 and 1000 mg on day 8; subsequent cycles: 1000 mg on day 1) for three to 12 cycles. Assignment was done with a randomisation list that was computer generated at GlaxoSmithKline, and was stratified, in a block size of two, by age, disease stage, and performance status. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population and assessment was done by an independent review committee that was masked to group assignment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00748189. FINDINGS We enrolled 447 patients, median age 69 years (range 35-92). Between Dec 22, 2008, and May 26, 2011, we randomly assigned 221 patients to chlorambucil plus ofatumumab and 226 patients to chlorambucil alone. Median progression-free survival was 22{\textperiodcentered}4 months (95% CI 19{\textperiodcentered}0-25{\textperiodcentered}2) in the group assigned to chlorambucil plus ofatumumab compared with 13{\textperiodcentered}1 months (10{\textperiodcentered}6-13{\textperiodcentered}8) in the group assigned to chlorambucil only (hazard ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}57, 95% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}45-0{\textperiodcentered}72; p<0{\textperiodcentered}0001). Grade 3 or greater adverse events were more common in the chlorambucil plus ofatumumab group (109 [50%] patients; vs 98 [43%] given chlorambucil alone), with neutropenia being the most common event (56 [26%] vs 32 [14%]). Grade 3 or greater infections had similar frequency in both groups. Grade 3 or greater infusion-related adverse events were reported in 22 (10%) patients given chlorambucil plus ofatumumab. Five (2%) patients died during treatment in each group. INTERPRETATION Addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil led to clinically important improvements with a manageable side-effect profile in treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who were elderly or had comorbidities. Chlorambucil plus ofatumumab is therefore an important treatment option for these patients who cannot tolerate more intensive therapy. FUNDING GlaxoSmithKline, Genmab A/S.},

In this study, we have extensively characterized the mutational status of TP53, SF3B1, BIRC3, NOTCH1, and ATM in 406 untreated CLL cases by ultra-deep next-generation sequencing, which detected subclonal mutations down to 0.3% allele frequency. Clonal dynamics were examined in longitudinal samples of 48 CLL patients. We identified a high proportion of subclonal mutations, isolated or associated with clonal aberrations. TP53 mutations were present in 10.6% of patients (6.4% clonal, 4.2% subclonal), ATM mutations in 11.1% (7.8% clonal, 1.3% subclonal, 2% germ line mutations considered pathogenic), SF3B1 mutations in 12.6% (7.4% clonal, 5.2% subclonal), NOTCH1 mutations in 21.8% (14.2% clonal, 7.6% subclonal), and BIRC3 mutations in 4.2% (2% clonal, 2.2% subclonal). ATM mutations, clonal SF3B1, and both clonal and subclonal NOTCH1 mutations predicted for shorter time to first treatment irrespective of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable-region gene (IGHV) mutational status. Clonal and subclonal TP53 and clonal NOTCH1 mutations predicted for shorter overall survival together with the IGHV mutational status. Clonal evolution in longitudinal samples mainly occurred in cases with mutations in the initial samples and was observed not only after chemotherapy but also in untreated patients. These findings suggest that the characterization of the subclonal architecture and its dynamics in the evolution of the disease may be relevant for the management of CLL patients.},

abstract = {B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is an accumulative disease of slowly proliferating CD5+ B lymphocytes that develops in the aging population. Whereas some patients with B-CLL have an indolent course and die after many years from unrelated causes, others progress very rapidly and succumb within a few years from this currently incurable leukemia. Over the past decade studies of the structure and function of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) used by these leukemic cells have helped redefine the nature of this disease. In this review we summarize and reinterpret several aspects of these BCR-related studies and how they might relate to the disease. In particular, we address the ability of antigens to select out and drive B cell clones from the normal state to overt leukemic cells by binding to BCRs that are relatively unique and characteristic of B-CLL cells. The differential capacity of some B-CLL cases to continue to transduce signals through the BCR during the leukemic phase and the consequences for the in vivo biology of the leukemic clone is also considered. Finally, we discuss current and emerging views of the cellular origin of B-CLL cells and the differentiation pathways down which we believe these cells progress.},

@article{Stamatopoulos2010,
abstract = {Background Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a neoplastic disorder that arises largely as a result of defective apoptosis leading to chemoresistance. Stromal cell-derived factor-1 and its receptor, CXCR4, have been shown to play an important role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell trafficking and survival. Design and Methods Since histone acetylation is involved in the modulation of gene expression, we evaluated the effects of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, on chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and in particular on cell survival, CXCR4 expression, migration, and drug sensitization. Results Here, we showed that treatment with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (20 $\mu$M) for 48 hours induced a decrease in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell viability via apoptosis (n=20, P=0.0032). Using specific caspase inhibitors, we demonstrated the participation of caspases-3, -6 and -8, suggesting an activation of the extrinsic pathway. Additionally, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid significantly decreased CXCR4 mRNA (n=10, P=0.0010) and protein expression (n=40, P<0.0001). As a result, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell migration in response to stromal cell-derived factor-1 (n=23, P<0.0001) or through bone marrow stromal cells was dramatically impaired. Consequently, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid reduced the protective effect of the microenvironment and thus sensitized chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to chemotherapy such as fludarabine. Conclusions In conclusion, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid induces apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells via the extrinsic pathway and down-regulates CXCR4 expression leading to decreased cell migration. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid in combination with other drugs represents a promising therapeutic approach to inhibiting migration, chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell survival and potentially overcoming drug resistance. {\textcopyright} 2010 Ferrata Storti Foundation.},

@article{Dohner1995,
abstract = {Conventional cytogenetic analysis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) has been very difficult, and the prognostic significance of specific chromosome aberrations is under discussion. Recent improvements in fluorescence in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques have provided an alternative approach for the detection of chromosome aberrations. Here, an interphase cytogenetic study was performed to analyze the incidence and prognostic significance of a p53 gene deletion in B-CLL and related disorders. We studied mononuclear cells from 100 patients with chronic B-cell leukemias [B-CLL, 90 patients; B-prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL), 7; Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), 3] by fluorescence ISH with a genomic p53 DNA probe. In a subset of patients, additional G-banding analysis and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis was performed. Seventeen of the 100 patients [17%; B-CLL, 11 of 90 (12%); WM, 1 of 3; B-PLL, 5 of 7] exhibited a monoallelic p53 gene deletion by ISH. G-banding analysis demonstrated abnormalities of chromosome 17 in 13 of these 17 patients, all leading to loss of band 17p13. SSCP analysis showed aberrant bands in 9 of 14 patients with a p53 gene deletion. None of 12 patients with a p53 gene deletion compared with 20 of 36 patients (56%) without a deletion responded to therapy with fludar-abine or pentostatin (P < .001). The difference in survival probabilities from the time of diagnosis and from the start of treatment with purine analogs between the two groups was highly significant (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, p53 gene deletion was the strongest prognostic factor for survival. In conclusion, p53 gene deletion predicts for non-response to therapy with purine analogs and for poor survival in chronic B-cell leukemias.},

@article{Quesada2012,
abstract = {Here we perform whole-exome sequencing of samples from 105 individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most frequent leukemia in adults in Western countries. We found 1,246 somatic mutations potentially affecting gene function and identified 78 genes with predicted functional alterations in more than one tumor sample. Among these genes, SF3B1, encoding a subunit of the spliceosomal U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), is somatically mutated in 9.7% of affected individuals. Further analysis in 279 individuals with CLL showed that SF3B1 mutations were associated with faster disease progression and poor overall survival. This work provides the first comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations in CLL with relevant clinical correlates and defines a large set of new genes that may drive the development of this common form of leukemia. The results reinforce the idea that targeting several well-known genetic pathways, including mRNA splicing, could be useful in the treatment of CLL and other malignancies.},
