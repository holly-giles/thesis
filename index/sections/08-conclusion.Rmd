TLR modulation could be prognostic - it is modualted by ATM and del11q- this coudl explain:

GEnetic resistance to BCR inhibition is well reserached, ME-induced resistance much less so:

Mutations in BTK and PLCγ2 were identified through whole-exome sequencing of peripheral blood samples from patients experiencing relapse after ibrutinib treatment, including a cysteine-to-serine mutation at position 481 in BTK (C481S) leading to a protein product with reduced kinase activity, that is only partially inhibited by ibrutinib [179, 180], and three putative gain-of-function mutations in PLCγ2, including arginine-to-tryptophan at position 665 (R665W), leucine to phenylalanine at position 845 (L845F) and serine to tyrosine at position 707 (S707Y) [179].
