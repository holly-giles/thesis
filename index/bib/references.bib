abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a malignancy of CD5+ B cells that is characterized by the accumulation of small, mature-appearing lymphocytes in the blood, marrow and lymphoid tissues. Signalling via surface immunoglobulin, which constitutes the major part of the B cell receptor, and several genetic alterations play a part in CLL pathogenesis, in addition to interactions between CLL cells and other cell types, such as stromal cells, T cells and nurse-like cells in the lymph nodes. The clinical progression of CLL is heterogeneous and ranges from patients who require treatment soon after diagnosis to others who do not require therapy for many years, if at all. Several factors, including the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutational status, genomic changes, patient age and the presence of comorbidities, should be considered when defining the optimal management strategies, which include chemotherapy, chemoimmunotherapy and/or drugs targeting B cell receptor signalling or inhibitors of apoptosis, such as BCL-2. Research on the biology of CLL has profoundly enhanced our ability to identify patients who are at higher risk for disease progression and our capacity to treat patients with drugs that selectively target distinctive phenotypic or physiological features of CLL. How these and other advances have shaped our current understanding and treatment of patients with CLL is the subject of this Primer.},

@article{Deseq2,
abstract = {In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present DESeq2, a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The DESeq2 package is available at http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html .},

@article{ConsensusClusterPlus,
abstract = {UNLABELLED Unsupervised class discovery is a highly useful technique in cancer research, where intrinsic groups sharing biological characteristics may exist but are unknown. The consensus clustering (CC) method provides quantitative and visual stability evidence for estimating the number of unsupervised classes in a dataset. ConsensusClusterPlus implements the CC method in R and extends it with new functionality and visualizations including item tracking, item-consensus and cluster-consensus plots. These new features provide users with detailed information that enable more specific decisions in unsupervised class discovery. AVAILABILITY ConsensusClusterPlus is open source software, written in R, under GPL-2, and available through the Bioconductor project (http://www.bioconductor.org/). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{Collins1989,
abstract = {Summary When B‐cell lymphocytic leukaemia (B‐CLL) cells derived from peripheral blood were cultured in vitro, a substantial proportion of them spontaneously died by apoptosis. This type of cell death is morphologically and biochemically distinct from necrosis and has previously been found to occur under physiologic and certain pathologic conditions where cell deletion appears controlled and biologically meaningful. By 30 h of culture, approximately 20% of the unfractionated B‐CLL cells were affected. There was no significant difference in the incidence of apoptosis in T‐cell depleted and undepleted cultures or when either autologous or normal human serum was used. Furthermore, seeding densities of 2 × 106 and 5 × 105 cells/ml resulted in a similar incidence of apoptosis, indicating that cell density was unlikely to be a contributing factor in producing the death. The finding that B‐CLL cells spontaneously die in vitro has at least two important implications. Firstly, previous work relating to some of the functions of B‐CLL cells and their interactions with T cells may require re‐evaluation. Secondly, an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the induction of apoptosis in this disease may have therapeutic consequences. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1989, Wiley Blackwell.
