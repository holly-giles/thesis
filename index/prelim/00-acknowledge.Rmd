# Acknowledgements {-}
I am very grateful to everyone that has supported me over the last four years. First and foremost, I would like to thank my PhD Supervisors Dr. Wolfgang Huber and Prof. Dr. Sascha Dietrich. Thank you Wolfgang, you have been an excellent mentor. You have led by example, and your collegial and rigorous approach to science have taught me skills that I aim to carry into the rest of my career. Thank you Sascha, I learned a great deal from you and your impressive clinical insight has been critical to this work.

I have also benefited from the generous input of other mentors. Thank you to Prof. Dr. Michael Boutros, Dr. Nassos Typas, Dr. Moritz Gerstung and Dr. Simon Anders for your valued advice and enthusiasm in engaging with my project at each TAC meeting. Thank you also to my referees and Defence committee. I would also like to thank Moritz for supporting me as a visiting student in Cambridge.  I really appreciate the time you have given to support my science.

I am grateful to all members of the Huber, Dietrich and Gerstung groups, past and present. It has been so rewarding to work with such motivated, talented and collegiate scientists.  Thank you to the Huber group for many enjoyable lunch times, coffee breaks and fabulous retreats, and of course thank you for all the support and input you have given me in group meetings, and in answering my questions. To Mike and Junyan, I am very grateful that you took the time to teach me good practice in R and answer my questions at any time of the day. I thank Gosia for her useful advice on how to approach this thesis. I am very grateful to Simone for all her support with the administrative side of my PhD. Thank you to Junyan and Katharina for providing invaluable feedback on my thesis and to Nils for sharing the Heididown package!

Thank you to the Dietrich group for our regular lunch time chats (and giving me some German practice) and for the support you have provided, especially when I was trying out new techniques in the lab! I would like to thank my colleague Peter-Martin Bruch: I learned a great deal from you and the project has benefited from your medical and experimental expertise. Thank you to Mareike, Angela, Caro and Tina, your support with experiments has been invaluable. I am grateful to the Gerstung group for welcoming me over the final six months of this project,  our regular morning calls and evening meet-ups have kept me motivated as I have written this thesis. 

My development as a PhD student and this project have also hugely benefited form working with collaborators and the technical support and advice they have provided. Thorsten Zenz and the Zenz group have provided essential input and infrastructure. Judith Zaugg and the Zaugg group have been generous with their time and expertise. I am grateful to Ivan and Christian for their support and I am glad to have been the first external user of diffTF, thank you for taking the time to teach me! Thank you also to Brian and Anna, you took the time to show me your experimental techniques in ATACseq and scATACseq. 

I would like to thank everyone who provided resources for this project, in particular Dr. Martina Seiffert who provided the HS-5 stromal cell line, Dr. Sophie Herbst for the proteomics dataset and Dr. Ivan Berest who provided access to the ATACseq dataset [@Rendeiro2016]. Thank you to each of the patients who gave their consent for blood samples to be included in this study. 

I am so glad to have had the opportunity to work at such collegial institutes and I would like to thank EMBL Heidelberg for providing such a fulfilling environment in which to work. In particular, the infrastructure at EMBL is so successful at fostering cutting-edge science, and I would like to thank the Gene Core and Proteomics Core Facilities, the Centre for Statistical Analysis and EMBL IT services for their help. Thank you also to the Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit (MMPU), for providing the infrastructure supporting such a close collaboration between my two labs. Thank you to EMBL-EBI for hosting me for the final six months of my PhD. The opportunity to work and study in Cambridge has been so positive, and proven invaluable in networking and building the next stages of my life and career. My time in Cambridge has been made more productive and enjoyable through the generosity of Dr. Robert Hunt and Dr. Helena Browne who have supported me as a visitor at Christ's College. 

This project would not have been possible without the funding received from the Department of Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, MMPU, EMBL Heidelberg, DKFZ, the Heidelberg Center for Personalised Oncology (HIPO), the Joachim-Herz Stiftung and the SIMONA grant. 

My PhD has been a huge learning curve, and I am grateful to my family and friends in Heidelberg, Cambridge and Portsmouth for supporting me.  Jakob, thank you for helping settle into Germany, even from the very first time we walked what felt like the entirety of Heidelberg during interview week (and of course thank you for guarding my flat all this time!).  Tim and Martine, thank you for being my fellow English-speaking pals, I miss all of our late night Guest house chats and dinners at Illegally Tasty. Thank you to Sally-Jane for your mentorship and support.  Thank you to all my UK friends who have also been there along the way, and visited many times in the last four years. Kesh, Henry, Adam, thank you for your morale-boosting trips to Cambridge. Thank you to Michael and Helena, our PhD chats have really got me through the last year, and  thank you to our lockdown zoom gang, we could not have got through Winter of 2020 without that! Thanks also to Coldplay (and Pete Tong), soundtrack of my PhD. 

Finally, and importantly, I would like to thank my family for all the support and mentorship they have provided during the course of my PhD. Milly, I am so glad you could live with me for a year in Heidelberg. Jim and Ann, I have appreciated your morale-boosting trips over to Cambridge while I have been writing this thesis, and of course for your venture to Heidelberg. Mum and Dad, thank you so much for your patience and positivity (and lifting skills), and for always keeping me on the right track.
