# Discussion
TLR and SPIB - perhaps they orperate via nfkb - manymutations centre on nfkb1:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25733685/
also nfkb1 is higher in trisomy 12 at rna and protein level

TLR couldbeprognostics 
the fact taht MYD88 mutations in TLR signalling are excluvisvely in IGHVM patients suggests they are only of advantage in IGHVM -perhaps they make TLR signalling pro-sruvival(or at least not toxic) 

 In addition, the MYD88 gene is mutated in ~3% of patients with CLL, exclusively those with IGHV-M CLL40,41 (Fig. 2; Table 1). MYD88, a cytosolic protein adaptor involved in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway, has pleiotropic functions in B cells, including NF-κB activation.
 
 only tirsomy 12 and MYD88 mutations are linked to a distinct epigenetic profile:

TLR modulation could be prognostic - it is modualted by ATM and del11q- this coudl explain:

overall and treatment-free survival that is independent of IGVH mutation status in patients

GEnetic resistance to BCR inhibition is well reserached, ME-induced resistance much less so:

Mutations in BTK and PLCγ2 were identified through whole-exome sequencing of peripheral blood samples from patients experiencing relapse after ibrutinib treatment, including a cysteine-to-serine mutation at position 481 in BTK (C481S) leading to a protein product with reduced kinase activity, that is only partially inhibited by ibrutinib [179, 180], and three putative gain-of-function mutations in PLCγ2, including arginine-to-tryptophan at position 665 (R665W), leucine to phenylalanine at position 845 (L845F) and serine to tyrosine at position 707 (S707Y) [179].
